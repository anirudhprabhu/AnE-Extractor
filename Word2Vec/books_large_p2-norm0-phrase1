of the peerless and ever cheery Howe Library in Hanover New_Hampshire Above_all and as always my profoundest thanks to my dear patient incomparable wife Cynthia Welcome And congratulations I_am delighted that you could make it Getting here wasn't easy Iknow In_fact I suspect it was a little tougher than you realize To begin with for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble in anintricate and intriguingly obliging manner to create you It's an arrangement so specialized andparticular that it has never been tried before and will only exist this once For the next many years we hope these tiny particles will uncomplainingly engage in all the billions of deft cooperativeefforts necessary to keep you intact and let you experience the supremely agreeable but generallyunderappreciated state known as existence Why atoms take this trouble is a bit of a puzzle Being you is not a gratifying experience at theatomic level For all their devoted attention your atoms don't actually care about you indeed don'teven know that you are there They don't even know that they are there They are mindless particles after all and not even themselves alive It is a slightly arresting notion that if you were to pickyourself apart with tweezers one atom at a time you would produce a mound of fine atomic dust none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been you Yet somehow for the periodof your existence they will answer to a single overarching impulse to keep you you The bad_news is that atoms are fickle and their time of devotion is fleeting fleeting indeed Evena long human life adds up to only about hours And when that modest milestone flashes past or at some other point thereabouts for reasons unknown your atoms will shut you down silentlydisassemble and go off to be other things And that's it for you Still you may rejoice that it happens at all Generally speaking in the universe it doesn't so far aswe can tell This is decidedly odd because the atoms that so liberally and congenially flock togetherto form living_things on Earth are exactly the same atoms that decline to do it elsewhere Whateverelse it may be at the level of chemistry life is curiously mundane carbon hydrogen oxygen andnitrogen a little calcium a dash of sulfur a light dusting of other very ordinary elements nothingyou wouldn't find in any ordinary drugstore and that's all you need The only thing special about theatoms that make you is that they make you That is of course the miracle of life Whether or not atoms make life in other corners of the universe they make plenty else indeed theymake everything else Without them there would be no water or air or rocks no stars and planets nodistant gassy clouds or swirling nebulae or any of the other things that make the universe so usefullymaterial Atoms are so numerous and necessary that we easily overlook that they needn't actually existat all There is no law that requires the universe to fill itself with small particles of matter or toproduce light and gravity and the other physical properties on which our existence hinges Thereneedn't actually be a universe at all For the longest time there wasn't There were no atoms and nouniverse for them to float about in There was nothing nothing at all anywhere So thank goodness for atoms But the fact that you have atoms and that they assemble in such awilling manner is only part of what got you here To be here now alive in the twenty first century andsmart enough to know it you also had to be the beneficiary of an extraordinary string of biologicalgood fortune Survival on Earth is a surprisingly tricky business Of the billions and billions ofspecies of living thing that have existed since the dawn of time most percent are no longeraround Life on Earth you see is not only brief but dismayingly tenuous It is a curious feature of ourexistence that we come from a planet that is very good at promoting life but even better atextinguishing it The average species on Earth lasts for only about four million_years so if you wish to be aroundfor billions of years you must be as fickle as the atoms that made you You must be prepared tochange everything about yourself shape size color species affiliation everything and to do sorepeatedly That's much easier said than done because the process of change is random To get from protoplasmal primordial atomic globule as the Gilbert and Sullivan song put it to sentient uprightmodern human has required you to mutate new traits over and over in a precisely timely manner for anexceedingly long while So at various periods over the last billion years you have abhorredoxygen and then doted on it grown fins and limbs and jaunty sails laid eggs flicked the air with aforked tongue been sleek been furry lived underground lived in trees been as big as a deer and assmall as a mouse and a million things more The tiniest deviation from any of these evolutionaryshifts and you might now be licking algae from cave walls or lolling walruslike on some stony shoreor disgorging air through a blowhole in the top of your head before diving sixty feet for a mouthful ofdelicious sandworms Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time immemorial to a favoredevolutionary line but you have also been extremely make that miraculously fortunate in yourpersonal ancestry Consider the fact that for billion years a period of time older than the Earth'smountains and rivers and oceans every one of your forebears on both_sides has been attractiveenough to find a mate healthy enough to reproduce and sufficiently blessed by fate and circumstancesto live long enough to do so Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed devoured drowned starved stranded stuck fast untimely wounded or otherwise deflected from its life's quest ofdelivering a tiny charge of genetic_material to the right partner at the right moment in order toperpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result eventually astoundingly and all too briefly in you This is a book about how it happened in particular how we went from there being nothing at all tothere being something and then how a little of that something turned into us and also some of whathappened in between and since That's a great_deal to cover of course which is why the book iscalled A Short History of Nearly Everything even though it isn't really It couldn't be But with luckby the time we finish it will feel as if it is My own starting point for what it's worth was an illustrated science book that I had as aclassroom text when I was in fourth or fifth grade The book was a standard issue s schoolbook battered unloved grimly hefty but near the front it had an illustration that just captivated me acutaway diagram showing the Earth's interior as it would look if you cut into the planet with a largeknife and carefully withdrew a wedge representing about a quarter of its bulk It's hard to believe that there was ever a time when I had not seen such an illustration before butevidently I had not for I clearly remember being transfixed I suspect in honesty my initial interestwas based on a private image of streams of unsuspecting eastbound motorists in the American plainsstates plunging over the edge of a sudden mile high cliff running between Central America andthe North Pole but gradually my attention did turn in a more scholarly manner to the scientific importof the drawing and the realization that the Earth consisted of discrete layers ending in the center witha glowing sphere of iron and nickel which was as hot as the surface of the Sun according to thecaption and I remember thinking with real wonder How do they know that I didn't doubt the correctness of the information for an instant I still tend to trust thepronouncements of scientists in the way I trust those of surgeons plumbers and other possessors ofarcane and privileged information but I couldn't for the life of me conceive how any human mindcould work out what spaces thousands of miles below us that no eye had ever seen and no X raycould penetrate could look like and be made of To me that was just a miracle That has been myposition with science ever_since Excited I took the book home that night and opened it before dinner an action that I expectprompted my mother to feel my forehead and ask if I was all right and starting with the first page Iread And here's the thing It wasn't exciting at all It wasn't actually altogether comprehensible Aboveall it didn't answer any of the questions that the illustration stirred up in a normal inquiring mind How did we end up with a Sun in the middle of our planet And if it is burning away down there whyisn't the ground under our feet hot to the touch And why isn't the rest of the interior melting or is it And when the core at last burns itself out will some of the Earth slump into the void leaving a giantsinkhole on the surface And how do you know this How did you figure it out But the author was strangely silent on such details indeed silent on everything but anticlines synclines axial faults and the like It was as if he wanted to keep the good stuff secret by making allof it soberly unfathomable As the years passed I began to suspect that this was not altogether aprivate impulse There seemed to be a mystifying universal conspiracy among textbook authors tomake certain the material they dealt with never strayed too near the realm of the mildly interesting andwas always at_least a long distance phone call from the frankly interesting I now know that there is a happy abundance of science writers who pen the most lucid and thrillingprose Timothy Ferris Richard_Fortey and Tim_Flannery are three that jump out from a singlestation of the alphabet and that's not even to mention the late but godlike Richard_Feynman butsadly none of them wrote any textbook I ever used All mine were written by men it was alwaysmen who held the interesting notion that everything became clear when expressed as a formula andthe amusingly deluded belief that the children of America would appreciate having chapters end witha section of questions they could mull over in their own time So I grew up convinced that sciencewas supremely dull but suspecting that it needn't be and not really thinking about it at all if I couldhelp it This too became my position for a long time Then much later about four or five years_ago I was on a long flight across the Pacific staringidly out the window at moonlit ocean when it occurred to me with a certain uncomfortableforcefulness that I didn't know the first thing about the only planet I was ever going to live on I had noidea for example why the oceans were salty but the Great Lakes weren't Didn't have the faintestidea I didn't know if the oceans were growing more salty with time or less and whether oceansalinity levels was something I should be concerned about or not I_am very pleased to tell you thatuntil the late_s scientists didn't know the answers to these questions either They just didn't talkabout it very audibly And ocean salinity of course represented only the merest sliver of my ignorance I didn't knowwhat a proton was or a protein didn't know a quark from a quasar didn't understand how geologistscould look at a layer of rock on a canyon wall and tell you how old it was didn't know anythingreally I became gripped by a quiet unwonted urge to know a little about these matters and tounderstand how people figured them out That to me remained the greatest of all amazements howscientists work things out How does anybody know how much the Earth weighs or how old its rocksare or what really is way down there in the center How can they know how and when the universestarted and what it was like when it did How do they know what goes on inside an atom And how come to that or perhaps above all can scientists so often seem to know nearly everything but thenstill can't predict an earthquake or even tell us whether we should take an umbrella with us to theraces next Wednesday So I decided that I would devote a portion of my life three years as it now turns_out to readingbooks and journals and finding saintly patient experts prepared to answer a lot of outstandingly dumbquestions The idea was to see if it isn't possible to understand and appreciate marvel at enjoy even the wonder and accomplishments of science at a level that isn't too technical or demanding but isn'tentirely superficial either That was my idea and my hope and that is what the book that follows is intended to be Anyway we have a great_deal of ground to cover and much less than hours in which to do it so let'sbegin PART I LOST IN THE COSMOS HOW TO BUILD A UNIVERSENO MATTER HOW hard you try you will never be able to grasp just how tiny how spatiallyunassuming is a proton It is just way too small A proton is an infinitesimal part of an atom which is itself of course an insubstantial thing Protonsare so small that a little dib of ink like the dot on this i can hold something in the region of of them rather more than the number of seconds contained in half a million_years So protons are exceedingly microscopic to say the very least Now imagine if you can and of course you can't shrinking one of those protons down to a billionthof its normal size into a space so small that it would make a proton look enormous Now pack intothat tiny tiny space about an ounce of matter Excellent You are ready to start a universe I'm assuming of course that you wish to build an inflationary universe If you'd prefer instead tobuild a more old fashioned standard Big_Bang universe you'll need additional materials In_fact youwill need to gather up everything there is every last mote and particle of matter between here andthe edge of creation and squeeze it into a spot so infinitesimally compact that it has no dimensions atall It is known as a singularity In either case get ready for a really big bang Naturally you will wish to retire to a safe place toobserve the spectacle Unfortunately there is nowhere to retire to because outside the singularitythere is no where When the universe begins to expand it won't be spreading out to fill a largeremptiness The only space that exists is the space it creates as it goes It is natural but wrong to visualize the singularity as a kind of pregnant dot hanging in a dark boundless void But there is no space no darkness The singularity has no around around it Thereis no space for it to occupy no place for it to be We can't even ask how long it has been there whether it has just lately popped into being like a good idea or whether it has been there forever quietly awaiting the right moment Time doesn't exist There is no past for it to emerge from And so from nothing our universe begins In a single blinding pulse a moment of glory much too swift and expansive for any form of words the singularity assumes heavenly dimensions space beyond conception In the first lively second asecond that many cosmologists will devote careers to shaving into ever finer wafers is producedgravity and the other forces that govern physics In less than a minute the universe is a million billionmiles across and growing fast There is a lot of heat now ten billion degrees of it enough to begin thenuclear reactions that create the lighter elements principally hydrogen and helium with a dash about one atom in a hundred million of lithium In three minutes percent of all the matter there isor will ever be has been produced We have a universe It is a place of the most wondrous andgratifying possibility and beautiful too And it was all done in about the time it takes to make asandwich When this moment happened is a matter of some debate Cosmologists have long argued overwhether the moment of creation was billion_years_ago or twice that or something in between Theconsensus seems to be heading for a figure of about billion years but these things are notoriouslydifficult to measure as we shall_see further on All that can really be said is that at someindeterminate point in the very distant past for reasons unknown there came the moment known toscience as t We were on our way There is of course a great_deal we_don't_know and much of what we think we know we haven'tknown or thought we've known for long Even the notion of the Big_Bang is quite a recent one Theidea had been kicking around since the s when Georges Lema tre a Belgian priest scholar firsttentatively proposed it but it didn't really become an active notion in cosmology until the mid swhen two young radio astronomers made an extraordinary and inadvertent discovery Their names were Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson In they were trying to make use of alarge communications antenna owned by Bell Laboratories at Holmdel New_Jersey but they weretroubled by a persistent background noise a steady steamy hiss that made any experimental workimpossible The noise was unrelenting and unfocused It came from every point in the sky day andnight through every season For a year the young astronomers did everything they could think of totrack down and eliminate the noise They tested every electrical system They rebuilt instruments checked circuits wiggled wires dusted plugs They climbed into the dish and placed duct tape overevery seam and rivet They climbed back into the dish with brooms and scrubbing brushes andcarefully swept it clean of what they referred to in a later paper as white dielectric material orwhat is known more commonly as bird shit Nothing they tried worked Unknown to them just thirty miles_away at Princeton University a team of scientists led by RobertDicke was working on how to find the very thing they were trying so diligently to get rid of ThePrinceton researchers were pursuing an idea that had been suggested in the s by the Russian bornastrophysicist George Gamow that if you looked deep enough into space you should find some cosmicbackground radiation left over from the Big_Bang Gamow calculated that by the time it crossed thevastness of the cosmos the radiation would reach Earth in the form of microwaves In a more recentpaper he had even suggested an instrument that might do the job the Bell antenna at Holmdel Unfortunately neither Penzias and Wilson nor any of the Princeton team had read Gamow's paper The noise that Penzias and Wilson were hearing was of course the noise that Gamow hadpostulated They had found the edge of the universe or at_least the visible part of it billion trillionmiles away They were seeing the first photons the most ancient light in the universe thoughtime and distance had converted them to microwaves just as Gamow had predicted In his book TheInflationary Universe Alan Guth provides an analogy that helps to put this finding in perspective Ifyou think of peering into the depths of the universe as like looking down from the hundredth floor ofthe Empire State Building with the hundredth floor representing now and street level representing themoment of the Big_Bang at the time of Wilson and Penzias's discovery the most distant galaxiesanyone had ever detected were on about the sixtieth floor and the most distant things quasars were on about the twentieth Penzias and Wilson's finding pushed our acquaintance with the visibleuniverse to within half an inch of the sidewalk Still unaware of what caused the noise Wilson and Penzias phoned Dicke at Princeton anddescribed their problem to him in the hope that he might suggest a solution Dicke realized at oncewhat the two young men had found Well boys we've just been scooped he told his colleagues ashe hung up the phone Soon_afterward the Astrophysical Journal published two articles one by Penzias and Wilsondescribing their experience with the hiss the other by Dicke's team explaining its nature AlthoughPenzias and Wilson had not been looking for cosmic background radiation didn't know what it waswhen they had found it and hadn't described or interpreted its character in any paper they receivedthe Nobel_Prize in physics The Princeton researchers got only sympathy According to DennisOverbye in Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos neither Penzias nor Wilson altogether understood thesignificance of what they had found until they read about it in the New_York_Times Incidentally disturbance from cosmic background radiation is something we have all experienced Tune your television to any channel it doesn't receive and about percent of the dancing static yousee is accounted for by this ancient remnant of the Big_Bang The next time you complain that there isnothing on remember that you can always watch the birth of the universe Although everyone calls it the Big_Bang many books caution us not to think of it as an explosion inthe conventional sense It was rather a vast sudden expansion on a whopping scale So what causedit One notion is that perhaps the singularity was the relic of an earlier collapsed universe thatwe're just one of an eternal cycle of expanding and collapsing universes like the bladder on anoxygen machine Others attribute the Big_Bang to what they call a false vacuum or a scalar field or vacuum energy some quality or thing at any rate that introduced a measure of instability intothe nothingness that was It seems impossible that you could get something from nothing but the factthat once there was nothing and now there is a universe is evident proof that you can It may be thatour universe is merely part of many larger universes some in different dimensions and that BigBangs are going on all the time all over the place Or it may be that space and time had some otherforms altogether before the Big_Bang forms too alien for us to imagine and that the Big Bangrepresents some sort of transition phase where the universe went from a form we can't understand toone we almost can These are very close to religious questions Dr Andrei Linde a cosmologist atStanford told the New_York_Times in The Big_Bang theory isn't about the bang itself but about what happened after the bang Not longafter mind you By doing a lot of math and watching carefully what goes on in particle accelerators scientists believe they can look back to seconds after the moment of creation when the universewas still so small that you would have needed a microscope to find it We mustn't swoon over everyextraordinary number that comes before us but it is perhaps worth latching on to one from time totime just to be reminded of their ungraspable and amazing breadth Thus is or one million trillion trillion trillionthsof a second Most of what we know or believe we know about the early moments of the universe is thanks toan idea called inflation theory first propounded in by a junior particle physicist then atStanford now at MIT named Alan Guth He was thirty two years_old and by his own admission hadnever done anything much before He would probably never have had his great theory except that hehappened to attend a lecture on the Big_Bang given by none other than Robert Dicke The lectureinspired Guth to take an interest in cosmology and in particular in the birth of the universe The eventual result was the inflation theory which holds that a fraction of a moment after the dawnof creation the universe underwent a sudden dramatic expansion It inflated in effect ran away withitself doubling in size every seconds The whole episode may have lasted no more than seconds that's one million million million million millionths of a second but it changed theuniverse from something you could hold in your hand to something at_least times bigger Inflation theory explains the ripples and eddiesthat make our universe possible Without it there would be no clumps of matter and thus no stars justdrifting gas and everlasting darkness According to Guth's theory at one ten millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of asecond gravity emerged After another ludicrously brief interval it was joined by electromagnetismand the strong and weak nuclear forces the stuff of physics These were joined an instant later byswarms of elementary particles the stuff of stuff From nothing at all suddenly there were swarmsof photons protons electrons neutrons and much else between and of each according tothe standard Big_Bang theory Such quantities are of course ungraspable It is enough to know that in a single cracking instant wewere endowed with a universe that was vast at_least a hundred billion light years across accordingto the theory but possibly any size up to infinite and perfectly arrayed for the creation of stars galaxies and other complex systems What is extraordinary from our point of view is how well it turned_out for us If the universe hadformed just a tiny bit differently if gravity were fractionally stronger or weaker if the expansionhad proceeded just a little more slowly or swiftly then there might never have been stable elementsto make you and me and the ground we stand on Had gravity been a trifle stronger the universe itselfmight have collapsed like a badly erected tent without precisely the right values to give it the rightdimensions and density and component parts Had it been weaker however nothing would havecoalesced The universe would have remained forever a dull scattered void This is one reason that some experts believe there may have been many other big bangs perhapstrillions and trillions of them spread through the mighty span of eternity and that the reason we existin this particular one is that this is one we could exist in As Edward P Tryon of ColumbiaUniversity once put it In answer to the question of why it happened I offer the modest proposal thatour Universe is simply one of those things which happen from time to time To which adds Guth Although the creation of a universe might be very unlikely Tryon emphasized that no one hadcounted the failed attempts Martin Rees Britain's astronomer royal believes that there are many universes possibly aninfinite number each with different attributes in different combinations and that we simply live inone that combines things in the way that allows us to exist He makes an analogy with a very largeclothing store If there is a large stock of clothing you're not surprised to find a suit that fits If thereare many universes each governed by a differing set of numbers there will be one where there is aparticular set of numbers suitable to life We are in that one Rees maintains that six numbers in particular govern our universe and that if any of these valueswere changed even very slightly things could not be as they are For example for the universe to existas it does requires that hydrogen be converted to helium in a precise but comparatively stately manner specifically in a way that converts seven one thousandths of its mass to energy Lower that valuevery slightly from percent to percent say and no transformation could take place theuniverse would consist of hydrogen and nothing else Raise the value very slightly to percent and bonding would be so wildly prolific that the hydrogen would long since have been exhausted In either case with the slightest tweaking of the numbers the universe as we know and need it wouldnot be here I should say that everything is just right so far In the long term gravity may turn out to be a little toostrong and one day it may halt the expansion of the universe and bring it collapsing in upon itself tillit crushes itself down into another singularity possibly to start the whole process over again On theother hand it may be too weak and the universe will keep racing away forever until everything is sofar apart that there is no chance of material interactions so that the universe becomes a place that isinert and dead but very roomy The third option is that gravity is just right critical density is thecosmologists' term for it and that it will hold the universe together at just the right dimensions toallow things to go on indefinitely Cosmologists in their lighter moments sometimes call this theGoldilocks effect that everything is just right For the record these three possible universes areknown respectively as closed open and flat Now the question that has occurred to all of us at some point is what would happen if you traveledout to the edge of the universe and as it were put your head through the curtains Where would yourhe a d be if it were no_longer in the universe What would you find beyond The answer disappointingly is that you can never get to the edge of the universe That's not because it would taketoo long to get there though of course it would but because even if you traveled outward andoutward in a straight line indefinitely and pugnaciously you would never arrive at an outer boundary Instead you would come back to where you began at which point presumably you would rather loseheart in the exercise and give up The reason for this is that the universe bends in a way we can'tadequately imagine in conformance with Einstein's theory of relativity which we will get to in duecourse For the moment it is enough to know that we are not adrift in some large ever expandingbubble Rather space curves in a way that allows it to be boundless but finite Space cannot evenproperly be said to be expanding because as the physicist and Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg notes solar systems and galaxies are not expanding and space itself is not expanding Rather the galaxiesare rushing apart It is all something of a challenge to intuition Or as the biologist J_B S Haldaneonce famously observed The universe is not only queerer than we suppose it is queerer than we cansuppose The analogy that is usually given for explaining the curvature of space is to try to imagine someonefrom a universe of flat surfaces who had never seen a sphere being brought to Earth No matter howfar he roamed across the planet's surface he would never find an edge He might eventually return tothe spot where he had started and would of course be utterly confounded to explain how that hadhappened Well we are in the same position in space as our puzzled flatlander only we areflummoxed by a higher dimension Just as there is no place where you can find the edge of the universe so there is no place where youcan stand at the center and say This is where it all began This is the centermost point of it all Weare all at the center of it all Actually we_don't_know that for sure we can't prove it mathematically Scientists just assume that we can't really be the center of the universe think what that would imply but that the phenomenon must be the same for all observers in all places Still we don't actuallyknow For us the universe goes only as far as light has traveled in the billions of years since the universewas formed This visible universe the universe we know and can talk about is a million millionmillion million that's miles across But according to mosttheories the universe at large the meta universe as it is sometimes called is vastly roomier still According to Rees the number of light years to the edge of this larger unseen universe would bewritten not with ten zeroes not even with a hundred but with millions In short there's more spacethan you can imagine already without going to the trouble of trying to envision some additionalbeyond For a long time the Big_Bang theory had one gaping hole that troubled a lot of people namely thatit couldn't begin to explain how we got here Although percent of all the matter that exists wascreated with the Big_Bang that matter consisted exclusively of light gases the helium hydrogen andlithium that we mentioned earlier Not one particle of the heavy stuff so vital to our_own being carbon nitrogen oxygen and all the rest emerged from the gaseous brew of creation But andhere's the troubling point to forge these heavy elements you need the kind of heat and energy of aBig Bang Yet there has been only one Big_Bang and it didn't produce them So where did they comefrom Interestingly the man who found the answer to that question was a cosmologist who heartilydespised the Big_Bang as a theory and coined the term Big_Bang sarcastically as a way of mockingit We'll get to him shortly but before we turn to the question of how we got here it might be worthtaking a few minutes to consider just where exactly here is WELCOME TO THE SOLAR SYSTEMASTRONOMERS THESE DAYS can do the most amazing things If someone struck a match on theMoon they could spot the flare From the tiniest throbs and wobbles of distant stars they can infer thesize and character and even potential habitability of planets much too remote to be seen planets sodistant that it would take us half a million_years in a spaceship to get there With their radiotelescopes they can capture wisps of radiation so preposterously faint that the total amount of energycollected from outside the solar_system by all of them together since collecting began in is less than the energy of a single snowflake striking the ground in the words of Carl Sagan In short there isn't a great_deal that goes on in the universe that astronomers can't find when theyhave a mind to Which is why it is all the more remarkable to reflect that until no one had evernoticed that Pluto has a moon In the summer of that year a young astronomer named James Christy atthe U_S Naval Observatory in Flagstaff Arizona was making a routine examination of photographicimages of Pluto when he saw that there was something there something blurry and uncertain butdefinitely other than Pluto Consulting a colleague named Robert Harrington he concluded that whathe was looking at was a moon And it wasn't just any moon Relative to the planet it was the biggestmoon in the solar_system This was actually something of a blow to Pluto's status as a planet which had never been terriblyrobust anyway Since previously the space occupied by the moon and the space occupied by Plutowere thought to be one and the same it meant that Pluto was much smaller than anyone had supposed smaller even than Mercury Indeed seven moons in the solar_system including our_own are larger Now a natural question is why it took so long for anyone to find a moon in our_own solar_system The answer is that it is partly a matter of where astronomers point their instruments and partly amatter of what their instruments are designed to detect and partly it's just Pluto Mostly it's wherethey point their instruments In the words of the astronomer Clark Chapman Most people think thatastronomers get out at night in observatories and scan the skies That's not true Almost all thetelescopes we have in the world are designed to peer at very tiny little pieces of the sky way off inthe distance to see a quasar or hunt for black holes or look at a distant galaxy The only real networkof telescopes that scans the skies has been designed and built by the military We have been spoiled by artists' renderings into imagining a clarity of resolution that doesn't existin actual astronomy Pluto in Christy's photograph is faint and fuzzy a piece of cosmic lint and itsmoon is not the romantically backlit crisply delineated companion orb you would get in a NationalGeographic painting but rather just a tiny and extremely indistinct hint of additional fuzziness Suchwas the fuzziness in fact that it took seven years for anyone to spot the moon again and thusindependently confirm its existence One nice touch about Christy's discovery was that it happened in Flagstaff for it was there in that Pluto had been found in the first place That seminal event in astronomy was largely to the creditof the astronomer Percival Lowell Lowell who came from one of the oldest and wealthiest Bostonfamilies the one in the famous ditty about Boston being the home of the bean and the cod whereLowells spoke only to Cabots while Cabots spoke only to God endowed the famous observatorythat bears his name but is most indelibly remembered for his belief that Mars was covered withcanals built by industrious Martians for purposes of conveying water from polar regions to the dry butproductive lands nearer the equator Lowell's other abiding conviction was that there existed somewhere out beyond Neptune anundiscovered ninth planet dubbed Planet X Lowell based this belief on irregularities he detected inthe orbits of Uranus and Neptune and devoted the last years of his life to trying to find the gassy gianthe was certain was out there Unfortunately he died suddenly in at_least partly exhausted by hisquest and the search fell into abeyance while Lowell's heirs squabbled over his estate However in partly as a way of deflecting attention away from the Mars canal saga which by now hadbecome a serious embarrassment the Lowell Observatory directors decided to resume the searchand to that end hired a young_man from Kansas named Clyde Tombaugh Tombaugh had no formal training as an astronomer but he was diligent and he was astute and aftera year's patient searching he somehow spotted Pluto a faint point of light in a glittery firmament Itwas a miraculous find and what made it all the more striking was that the observations on whichLowell had predicted the existence of a planet beyond Neptune proved to be comprehensivelyerroneous Tombaugh could see at once that the new planet was nothing like the massive gasballLowell had postulated but any reservations he or anyone else had about the character of the newplanet were soon swept aside in the delirium that attended almost any big news story in that easilyexcited age This was the first American discovered planet and no one was going to be distracted bythe thought that it was really just a distant icy dot It was named Pluto at_least partly because the firsttwo letters made a monogram from Lowell's initials Lowell was posthumously hailed everywhere asa genius of the first order and Tombaugh was largely forgotten except among planetary astronomers who tend to revere him A few astronomers continue to think there may be a Planet X out there a real whopper perhaps asmuch as ten times the size of Jupiter but so far out as to be invisible to us It would receive so littlesunlight that it would have almost none to reflect The idea is that it wouldn't be a conventionalplanet like Jupiter or Saturn it's much too far away for that we're talking perhaps trillion miles but more like a sun that never quite made it Most star systems in the cosmos are binary doublestarred which makes our solitary sun a slight oddity As for Pluto itself nobody is quite sure how big it is or what it is made of what kind ofatmosphere it has or even what it really is A lot of astronomers believe it isn't a planet at all butmerely the largest object so far found in a zone of galactic debris known as the Kuiper belt TheKuiper belt was actually theorized by an astronomer named F C Leonard in but the namehonors Gerard Kuiper a Dutch native working in America who expanded the idea The Kuiper beltis the source of what are known as short period comets those that come past pretty regularly ofwhich the most famous is Halley's comet The more reclusive long period comets among them therecent visitors Hale Bopp and Hyakutake come from the much more distant Oort_cloud about whichmore presently It is certainly true that Pluto doesn't act much like the other planets Not only is it runty and obscure but it is so variable in its motions that no one can tell you exactly where Pluto will be a centuryhence Whereas the other planets orbit on more or less the same plane Pluto's orbital path is tipped as it were out of alignment at an angle of seventeen degrees like the brim of a hat tilted rakishly onsomeone's head Its orbit is so irregular that for substantial periods on each of its lonely circuitsaround the Sun it is closer to us than Neptune is For most of the s and s Neptune was infact the solar system's most far flung planet Only on February did Pluto return to theoutside lane there to remain for the next years So if Pluto really is a planet it is certainly an odd one It is very tiny just one quarter of percentas massive as Earth If you set it down on top of the United_States it would cover not quite half thelower forty eight states This alone makes it extremely anomalous it means that our planetary systemconsists of four rocky inner planets four gassy outer giants and a tiny solitary iceball Moreover there is every reason to suppose that we may soon begin to find other even larger icy spheres in thesame portion of space Then we will have problems After Christy spotted Pluto's moon astronomersbegan to regard that section of the cosmos more attentively and as of early December had foundover six hundred additional Trans Neptunian Objects or Plutinos as they are alternatively called One dubbed Varuna is nearly as big as Pluto's moon Astronomers now think there may be billionsof these objects The difficulty is that many of them are awfully dark Typically they have an albedo or reflectiveness of just percent about the same as a lump of charcoal and of course these lumpsof charcoal are about four billion miles_away And how far is that exactly It's almost beyond imagining Space you see is just enormous justenormous Let's imagine for purposes of edification and entertainment that we are about to go on ajourney by rocketship We won't go terribly far just to the edge of our_own solar_system but weneed to get a fix on how big a place space is and what a small part of it we occupy Now the bad_news I'm_afraid is that we won't be home for supper Even at the speed of light itwould take seven hours to get to Pluto But of course we can't travel at anything like that speed We'llhave to go at the speed of a spaceship and these are rather more lumbering The best speeds yetachieved by any human object are those of the Voyager and spacecraft which are now flyingaway from us at about thirty five thousand miles an_hour The reason the Voyager craft were launched when they were in August and September wasthat Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune were aligned in a way that happens only once every years This enabled the two Voyagers to use a gravity assist technique in which the craft weresuccessively flung from one gassy giant to the next in a kind of cosmic version of crack the whip Even so it took them nine years to reach Uranus and a dozen to cross the orbit of Pluto The goodnews is that if we wait until January which is when NASA's New Horizons spacecraft istentatively scheduled to depart for Pluto we can take advantage of favorable Jovian positioning plussome advances in technology and get there in only a decade or so though getting home again willtake rather longer I'm_afraid At all events it's going to be a long trip Now the first thing you are likely to realize is that space is extremely well named and ratherdismayingly uneventful Our solar_system may be the liveliest thing for trillions of miles but all thevisible stuff in it the Sun the planets and their moons the billion or so tumbling rocks of theasteroid belt comets and other miscellaneous drifting detritus fills less than a trillionth of theavailable space You also quickly realize that none of the maps you have ever seen of the solarsystem were remotely drawn to scale Most schoolroom charts show the planets coming one after theother at neighborly intervals the outer giants actually cast shadows over each other in manyillustrations but this is a necessary deceit to get them all on the same piece of paper Neptune inreality isn't just a little bit beyond Jupiter it's way beyond Jupiter five times farther from Jupiterthan Jupiter is from us so far out that it receives only percent as much sunlight as Jupiter Such are the distances in fact that it isn't possible in any practical terms to draw the solar systemto scale Even if you added lots of fold out pages to your textbooks or used a really long sheet ofposter paper you wouldn't come close On a diagram of the solar_system to scale with Earth reducedto about the diameter of a pea Jupiter would be over a thousand feet away and Pluto would be a mileand a half distant and about the size of a bacterium so you wouldn't be able to see it anyway On thesame scale Proxima Centauri our nearest star would be almost ten_thousand miles_away Even if youshrank down everything so that Jupiter was as small as the period at the end of this sentence andPluto was no bigger_than a molecule Pluto would still be over thirty five feet away So the solar_system is really quite enormous By the time we reach Pluto we have come so far thatthe Sun our dear warm skin tanning life giving Sun has shrunk to the size of a pinhead It is littlemore than a bright star In such a lonely void you can begin to understand how even the mostsignificant objects Pluto's moon for example have escaped attention In this respect Pluto hashardly been alone Until the Voyager expeditions Neptune was thought to have two moons Voyagerfound six more When I was a boy the solar_system was thought to contain thirty moons The totalnow is at_least ninety about a third of which have been found in just the last ten years The point to remember of course is that when considering the universe at large we don't actuallyknow what is in our_own solar_system Now the other thing you will notice as we speed past Pluto is that we are speeding past Pluto Ifyou check your itinerary you will see that this is a trip to the edge of our solar_system and I'm afraidwe're not there yet Pluto may be the last object marked on schoolroom charts but the system doesn'tend there In_fact it isn't even close to ending there We won't get to the solar system's edge until wehave passed through the Oort_cloud a vast celestial realm of drifting comets and we won't reach theOort cloud for another I'm so sorry about this ten_thousand years Far from marking the outer edgeof the solar_system as those schoolroom maps so cavalierly imply Pluto is barely one fiftythousandth of the way Of_course we have no prospect of such a journey A trip of miles to the Moon stillrepresents a very big undertaking for us A manned mission to Mars called for by the first PresidentBush in a moment of passing giddiness was quietly dropped when someone worked out that it wouldcost billion and probably result in the deaths of all the crew their DNA torn to tatters by highenergy solar particles from which they could not be shielded Based on what we know now and can reasonably imagine there is absolutely no prospect that anyhuman being will ever visit the edge of our_own solar_system ever It is just too far As it is evenwith the Hubble telescope we can't see even into the Oort_cloud so we don't actually know that it isthere Its existence is probable but entirely hypothetical About all that can be said with confidence about the Oort_cloud is that it starts somewhere beyondPluto and stretches some two light years out into the cosmos The basic unit of measure in the solarsystem is the Astronomical Unit or AU representing the distance from the Sun to the Earth Pluto isabout forty AUs from us the heart of the Oort_cloud about fifty thousand In a word it is remote But let's pretend again that we have made it to the Oort_cloud The first thing you might notice ishow very peaceful it is out here We're a long way from anywhere now so far from our_own Sun thatit's not even the brightest star in the sky It is a remarkable thought that that distant tiny twinkle hasenough gravity to hold all these comets in orbit It's not a very strong bond so the comets drift in astately manner moving at only about miles an_hour From time to time some of these lonelycomets are nudged out of their normal orbit by some slight gravitational perturbation a passing starperhaps Sometimes they are ejected into the emptiness of space never to be seen again butsometimes they fall into a long orbit around the Sun About three or four of these a year known aslong period comets pass through the inner solar_system Just occasionally these stray visitors smackinto something solid like Earth That's_why we've come out here now because the comet we havecome to see has just begun a long fall toward the center of the solar_system It is headed for of allplaces Manson Iowa It is going to take a long time to get there three or four million_years at_least so we'll leave it for now and return to it much later in the story So that's your solar_system And what else is out there beyond the solar_system Well nothing and agreat deal depending on how you look at it In the short term it's nothing The most perfect vacuum ever created by humans is not as empty asthe emptiness of interstellar space And there is a great_deal of this nothingness until you get to thenext bit of something Our nearest neighbor in the cosmos Proxima Centauri which is part of thethree star cluster known as Alpha Centauri is light years away a sissy skip in galactic terms butthat is still a hundred million times farther than a trip to the Moon To reach it by spaceship wouldtake at_least twenty_five thousand years and even if you made the trip you still wouldn't be anywhereexcept at a lonely clutch of stars in the middle of a vast nowhere To reach the next landmark ofconsequence Sirius would involve another light years of travel And so it would go if you triedto star hop your way across the cosmos Just reaching the center of our_own galaxy would take farlonger than we have existed as beings Space let me repeat is enormous The average distance between stars out there is millionmillion miles Even at speeds approaching those of light these are fantastically challenging distancesfor any traveling individual Of_course it is possible that alien beings travel billions of miles toamuse themselves by planting crop circles in Wiltshire or frightening the daylights out of some poorguy in a pickup truck on a lonely road in Arizona they must have teenagers after all but it doesseem unlikely Still statistically the probability that there are other thinking beings out there is good Nobodyknows how many stars there are in the Milky_Way estimates range from billion or so to perhaps billion and the Milky_Way is just one of billion or so other galaxies many of them evenlarger than ours In the s a professor at Cornell named Frank Drake excited by such whoppingnumbers worked out a famous equation designed to calculate the chances of advanced life in thecosmos based on a series of diminishing probabilities Under Drake's equation you divide the number of stars in a selected portion of the universe by thenumber of stars that are likely to have planetary systems divide that by the number of planetarysystems that could theoretically support life divide that by the number on which life having arisen advances to a state of intelligence and so on At each such division the number shrinks colossally yet even with the most conservative inputs the number of advanced civilizations just in the Milky Wayalways works out to be somewhere in the millions What an interesting and exciting thought We may be only one of millions of advanced civilizations Unfortunately space being spacious the average distance between any two of these civilizations isreckoned to be at_least two hundred light years which is a great_deal more than merely saying itmakes it sound It means for a start that even if these beings know we are here and are somehow ableto see us in their telescopes they're watching light that left Earth two hundred years_ago So they'renot seeing you and me They're watching the French Revolution and Thomas Jefferson and people insilk stockings and powdered wigs people who don't_know what an atom is or a gene and whomake their electricity by rubbing a rod of amber with a piece of fur and think that's quite a trick Anymessage we receive from them is likely to begin Dear Sire and congratulate us on thehandsomeness of our horses and our mastery of whale oil Two hundred light years is a distance sofar beyond us as to be well just beyond us So even if we are not really alone in all practical terms we are Carl Sagan calculated the numberof probable planets in the universe at large at billion trillion a number vastly beyond imagining But what is equally beyond imagining is the amount of space through which they are lightly scattered If we were randomly inserted into the universe Sagan wrote the chances that you would be on ornear a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion That's or a one followed bythirty three zeroes Worlds are precious Which is why perhaps it is good_news that in February the International Astronomical Unionruled officially that Pluto is a planet The universe is a big and lonely place We can do with all theneighbors we can get THE REVEREND EVANS'S UNIVERSEWHEN THE SKIES are clear and the Moon is not too bright the Reverend Robert Evans a quiet andcheerful man lugs a bulky telescope onto the back deck of his home in the Blue Mountains ofAustralia about fifty miles west of Sydney and does an extraordinary thing He looks deep into thepast and finds dying stars Looking into the past is of course the easy part Glance at the night sky and what you see is historyand lots of it the stars not as they are now but as they were when their light left them For all weknow the North Star our faithful companion might actually have burned out last January or in or at any time since the early fourteenth century and news of it just hasn't reached us yet The best wecan say can ever say is that it was still burning on this date years_ago Stars die all the time What Bob Evans does better than anyone else who has ever tried is spot these moments of celestialfarewell By day Evans is a kindly and now semiretired minister in the Uniting Church in Australia whodoes a bit of freelance work and researches the history of nineteenth_century religious movements But by night he is in his unassuming way a titan of the skies He hunts supernovae Supernovae occur when a giant star one much bigger_than our_own Sun collapses and thenspectacularly explodes releasing in an instant the energy of a hundred billion suns burning for a timebrighter than all the stars in its galaxy It's like a trillion hydrogen bombs going off at once saysEvans If a supernova explosion happened within five hundred light years of us we would be goners according to Evans it would wreck the show as he cheerfully puts it But the universe is vast andsupernovae are normally much too far away to harm us In_fact most are so unimaginably distant thattheir light reaches us as no more than the faintest twinkle For the month or so that they are visible allthat distinguishes them from the other stars in the sky is that they occupy a point of space that wasn'tfilled before It is these anomalous very occasional pricks in the crowded dome of the night sky thatthe Reverend Evans finds To understand what a feat this is imagine a standard dining room table covered in a blacktablecloth and someone throwing a handful of salt across it The scattered grains can be thought of asa galaxy Now imagine fifteen hundred more tables like the first one enough to fill a Wal Martparking lot say or to make a single line two miles long each with a random array of salt across it Now add one grain of salt to any table and let Bob Evans walk among them At a glance he will spotit That grain of salt is the supernova Evans's is a talent so exceptional that Oliver Sacks in An Anthropologist on Mars devotes apassage to him in a chapter on autistic savants quickly adding that there is no suggestion that he isautistic Evans who has not met Sacks laughs at the suggestion that he might be either autistic or asavant but he is powerless to explain quite where his talent comes from I just seem to have a knack for memorizing star fields he told_me with a frankly apologetic look when I visited him and his wife Elaine in their picture book bungalow on a tranquil edge of thevillage of Hazelbrook out where Sydney finally ends and the boundless Australian bush begins I'mnot particularly good at other things he added I don't remember names well Or where he's put things called Elaine from the kitchen He nodded frankly again and grinned then asked me if I'd like to see his telescope I had imaginedthat Evans would have a proper observatory in his backyard a scaled down version of a MountWilson or Palomar with a sliding domed roof and a mechanized chair that would be a pleasure tomaneuver In_fact he led me not outside but to a crowded storeroom off the kitchen where he keepshis books and papers and where his telescope a white cylinder that is about the size and shape of ahousehold hot water tank rests in a homemade swiveling plywood mount When he wishes toobserve he carries them in two trips to a small deck off the kitchen Between the overhang of the roofand the feathery tops of eucalyptus trees growing up from the slope below he has only a letter boxview of the sky but he says it is more than good enough for his purposes And there when the skiesare clear and the Moon not too bright he finds his supernovae The term supernova was coined in the s by a memorably odd astrophysicist named Fritz Zwicky Born in Bulgaria and raised in Switzerland Zwicky came to the California Institute of Technology inthe s and there at once distinguished himself by his abrasive personality and erratic talents Hedidn't seem to be outstandingly bright and many of his colleagues considered him little more than anirritating buffoon A fitness buff he would often drop to the floor of the Caltech dining hall or otherpublic areas and do one armed pushups to demonstrate his virility to anyone who seemed inclined todoubt it He was notoriously aggressive his manner eventually becoming so intimidating that hisclosest collaborator a gentle man named Walter Baade refused to be left alone with him Amongother things Zwicky accused Baade who was German of being a Nazi which he was not On at leastone occasion Zwicky threatened to kill Baade who worked up the hill at the Mount WilsonObservatory if he saw him on the Caltech campus But Zwicky was also capable of insights of the most startling brilliance In the early_s heturned his attention to a question that had long troubled astronomers the appearance in the sky ofoccasional unexplained points of light new stars Improbably he wondered if the neutron thesubatomic particle that had just been discovered in England by James Chadwick and was thus bothnovel and rather fashionable might be at the heart of things It occurred to him that if a starcollapsed to the sort of densities found in the core of atoms the result would be an unimaginablycompacted core Atoms would literally be crushed together their electrons forced into the nucleus forming neutrons You would have a neutron star Imagine a million really weighty cannonballssqueezed down to the size of a marble and well you're still not even close The core of a neutronstar is so dense that a single spoonful of matter from it would weigh billion pounds A spoonful But there was more Zwicky realized that after the collapse of such a star there would be a hugeamount of energy left over enough to make the biggest bang in the universe He called these resultantexplosions supernovae They would be they are the biggest events in creation On January the journal Physical Review published a very concise abstract of apresentation that had been conducted by Zwicky and Baade the previous month at Stanford University Despite its extreme brevity one paragraph of twenty four lines the abstract contained an enormousamount of new science it provided the first reference to supernovae and to neutron stars convincingly explained their method of formation correctly calculated the scale of theirexplosiveness and as a kind of concluding bonus connected supernova explosions to the productionof a mysterious new phenomenon called cosmic_rays which had recently been found swarmingthrough the universe These ideas were revolutionary to say the least Neutron stars wouldn't beconfirmed for thirty four years The cosmic_rays notion though considered plausible hasn't beenverified yet Altogether the abstract was in the words of Caltech astrophysicist Kip S Thorne oneof the most prescient documents in the history of physics and astronomy Interestingly Zwicky had almost no understanding of why any of this would happen According toThorne he did not understand the laws of physics well enough to be able to substantiate his ideas Zwicky's talent was for big ideas Others Baade mostly were left to do the mathematical sweepingup Zwicky also was the first to recognize that there wasn't nearly enough visible mass in the universeto hold galaxies together and that there must be some other gravitational influence what we now calldark matter One thing he failed to see was that if a neutron star shrank enough it would become sodense that even light couldn't escape its immense gravitational pull You would have a black hole Unfortunately Zwicky was held in such disdain by most of his colleagues that his ideas attractedalmost no notice When five years later the great Robert Oppenheimer turned his attention to neutronstars in a landmark paper he made not a single reference to any of Zwicky's work even thoughZwicky had been working for years on the same problem in an office just down the hall Zwicky'sdeductions concerning dark matter wouldn't attract serious attention for nearly four decades We canonly assume that he did a lot of pushups in this period Surprisingly little of the universe is visible to us when we incline our heads to the sky Only about stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth and only about can be seen from any onespot With binoculars the number of stars you can see from a single location rises to about and with a small two inch telescope it leaps to With a sixteen inch telescope such as Evansuses you begin to count not in stars but in galaxies From his deck Evans supposes he can seebetween and galaxies each containing tens of billions of stars These are of courserespectable numbers but even with so much to take in supernovae are extremely rare A star can burnfor billions of years but it dies just once and quickly and only a few dying stars explode Mostexpire quietly like a campfire at dawn In a typical galaxy consisting of a hundred billion stars asupernova will occur on average once every two or three hundred years Finding a supernovatherefore was a little bit like standing on the observation platform of the Empire State Building with atelescope and searching windows around Manhattan in the hope of finding let us say someonelighting a twenty first birthday cake So when a hopeful and softspoken minister got in touch to ask if they had any usable field charts forhunting supernovae the astronomical community thought he was out of his mind At the time Evanshad a ten inch telescope a very respectable size for amateur stargazing but hardly the sort of thingwith which to do serious cosmology and he was proposing to find one of the universe's rarerphenomena In the whole of astronomical history before Evans started looking in fewer thansixty supernovae had been found At the time I visited him in August of he had just recordedhis thirty fourth visual discovery a thirty fifth followed three months later and a thirty sixth in early Evans however had certain advantages Most observers like most people generally are in thenorthern hemisphere so he had a lot of sky largely to himself especially at first He also had speedand his uncanny memory Large telescopes are cumbersome things and much of their operational timeis consumed with being maneuvered into position Evans could swing his little sixteen inch telescopearound like a tail gunner in a dogfight spending no more than a couple of seconds on any particularpoint in the sky In consequence he could observe perhaps four_hundred galaxies in an evening whilea large professional telescope would be lucky to do fifty or sixty Looking for supernovae is mostly a matter of not finding them From to he averaged twodiscoveries a year not a huge payoff for hundreds of nights of peering and peering Once he foundthree in fifteen days but another time he went three years without finding any at all There is actually a certain value in not finding anything he said It helps cosmologists to workout the rate at which galaxies are evolving It's one of those rare areas where the absence of evidenceis evidence On a table beside the telescope were stacks of photos and papers relevant to his pursuits and heshowed me some of them now If you have ever looked through popular astronomical publications and at some time you must have you will know that they are generally full of richly luminous colorphotos of distant nebulae and the like fairy lit clouds of celestial light of the most delicate andmoving splendor Evans's working images are nothing like that They are just blurry black and whitephotos with little points of haloed brightness One he showed me depicted a swarm of stars with atrifling flare that I had to put close to my face to see This Evans told_me was a star in a constellationcalled Fornax from a galaxy known to astronomy as NGC NGC stands for New GeneralCatalogue where these things are recorded Once it was a heavy book on someone's desk in Dublin today needless to say it's a database For sixty million silent years the light from the star'sspectacular demise traveled unceasingly through space until one night in August of it arrived atEarth in the form of a puff of radiance the tiniest brightening in the night sky It was of course RobertEvans on his eucalypt scented hillside who spotted it There's something satisfying I think Evans said about the idea of light traveling for millions ofyears through space and just at the right moment as it reaches Earth someone looks at the right bit ofsky and sees it It just seems right that an event of that magnitude should be witnessed Supernovae do much more than simply impart a sense of wonder They come in several types oneof them discovered by Evans and of these one in particular known as a Ia supernova is important toastronomy because it always explodes in the same way with the same critical mass For this reason itcan be used as a standard candle to measure the expansion rate of the universe In Saul Perlmutter at the Lawrence Berkeley lab in California needing more Ia supernovaethan visual sightings were providing set out to find a more systematic method of searching for them Perlmutter devised a nifty system using sophisticated computers and charge coupled devices inessence really good digital cameras It automated supernova hunting Telescopes could now takethousands of pictures and let a computer detect the telltale bright spots that marked a supernovaexplosion In five years with the new technique Perlmutter and his colleagues at Berkeley foundforty two supernovae Now even amateurs are finding supernovae with charge coupled devices With CCDs you can aim a telescope at the sky and go watch television Evans said with a touch ofdismay It took all the romance out of it I_asked_him if he was tempted to adopt the new technology Oh no he said I enjoy my way toomuch Besides he gave a nod at the photo of his latest supernova and smiled I can still beat themsometimes The question that naturally occurs is What would it be like if a star exploded nearby Ournearest stellar neighbor as we have seen is Alpha Centauri light years away I had imagined thatif there were an explosion there we would have years to watch the light of this magnificent eventspreading across the sky as if tipped from a giant can What would it be like if we had four years andfour months to watch an inescapable doom advancing toward us knowing that when it finally arrivedit would blow the skin right off our bones Would people still go to work Would farmers plantcrops Would anyone deliver them to the stores Weeks later back in the town in New_Hampshire where I live I put these questions to JohnThorstensen an astronomer at Dartmouth College Oh no he said laughing The news of such anevent travels out at the speed of light but so does the destructiveness so you'd learn about it and diefrom it in the same instant But don't worry because it's not going to happen For the blast of a supernova explosion to kill you he explained you would have to be ridiculously close probably within ten light years or so The danger would be various types ofradiation cosmic_rays and so on These would produce fabulous auroras shimmering curtains ofspooky light that would fill the whole sky This would not be a good thing Anything potent enough toput on such a show could well blow away the magnetosphere the magnetic zone high above the Earththat normally protects us from ultraviolet rays and other cosmic assaults Without the magnetosphereanyone unfortunate enough to step into sunlight would pretty quickly take on the appearance of let ussay an overcooked pizza The reason we can be reasonably confident that such an event won't happen in our corner of thegalaxy Thorstensen said is that it takes a particular kind of star to make a supernova in the firstplace A candidate star must be ten to twenty times as massive as our_own Sun and we don't haveanything of the requisite size that's that close The universe is a mercifully big place The nearestlikely candidate he added is Betelgeuse whose various sputterings have for years suggested thatsomething interestingly unstable is going on there But Betelgeuse is fifty thousand light years away Only half a dozen times in recorded history have supernovae been close enough to be visible to thenaked eye One was a blast in that created the Crab Nebula Another in made a star brightenough to be seen during the day for over three weeks The most recent was in when asupernova flared in a zone of the cosmos known as the Large Magellanic Cloud but that was onlybarely visible and only in the southern hemisphere and it was a comfortably safe lightyears away Supernovae are significant to us in one other decidedly central way Without them we wouldn't behere You will recall the cosmological conundrum with which we ended the first chapter that theBig Bang created lots of light gases but no heavy elements Those came later but for a very long timenobody could figure out how they came later The problem was that you needed something really hot hotter even than the middle of the hottest stars to forge carbon and iron and the other elementswithout which we would be distressingly immaterial Supernovae provided the explanation and itwas an English cosmologist almost as singular in manner as Fritz Zwicky who figured it out He was a Yorkshireman named Fred Hoyle Hoyle who died in was described in anobituary in Nature as a cosmologist and controversialist and both of those he most certainly was He was according to Nature's obituary embroiled in controversy for most of his life and put hisname to much rubbish He claimed for_instance and without evidence that the Natural HistoryMuseum's treasured fossil of an Archaeopteryx was a forgery along the lines of the Piltdown hoax causing much exasperation to the museum's paleontologists who had to spend days fielding phonecalls from journalists from all over the world He also believed that Earth was not only seeded bylife from space but also by many of its diseases such as influenza and bubonic plague and suggestedat one point that humans evolved projecting noses with the nostrils underneath as a way of keepingcosmic pathogens from falling into them It was he who coined the term Big_Bang in a moment of facetiousness for a radio broadcast in He pointed_out that nothing in our_understanding of physics could account for why everything gathered to a point would suddenly and dramatically begin to expand Hoyle favored a steady statetheory in which the universe was constantly expanding and continually creating new matter as it went Hoyle also realized that if stars imploded they would liberate huge_amounts of heat milliondegrees or more enough to begin to generate the heavier elements in a process known asnucleosynthesis In working with others Hoyle showed how the heavier elements were formedin supernova explosions For this work W A Fowler one of his collaborators received a NobelPrize Hoyle shamefully did not According to Hoyle's theory an exploding star would generate enough heat to create all the newelements and spray them into the cosmos where they would form gaseous clouds the interstellarmedium as it is known that could eventually coalesce into new solar systems With the new theoriesit became possible at last to construct plausible scenarios for how we got here What we now thinkwe know is this About billion_years_ago a great swirl of gas and dust some billion miles acrossaccumulated in space where we are now and began to aggregate Virtually all of it percent ofthe mass of the solar_system went to make the Sun Out of the floating material that was left over two microscopic grains floated close enough together to be joined by electrostatic forces This wasthe moment of conception for our planet All over the inchoate solar_system the same was happening Colliding dust grains formed larger and larger clumps Eventually the clumps grew large enough to becalled planetesimals As these endlessly bumped and collided they fractured or split or recombinedin endless random permutations but in every encounter there was a winner and some of the winnersgrew big enough to dominate the orbit around which they traveled It all happened remarkably quickly To grow from a tiny cluster of grains to a baby planet somehundreds of miles across is thought to have taken only a few tens of thousands of years In just million_years possibly less the Earth was essentially formed though still molten and subject toconstant bombardment from all the debris that remained floating about At this point about billion_years_ago an object the size of Mars crashed into Earth blowing outenough material to form a companion sphere the Moon Within weeks it is thought the flung materialhad reassembled itself into a single clump and within a year it had formed into the spherical rock thatcompanions us yet Most of the lunar material it is thought came from the Earth's_crust not its core which is why the Moon has so little iron while we have a lot The theory incidentally is almostalways presented as a recent one but in fact it was first proposed in the s by Reginald Daly ofHarvard The only recent thing about it is people paying any attention to it When Earth was only about a third of its eventual size it was probably already beginning to forman atmosphere mostly of carbon_dioxide nitrogen methane and sulfur Hardly the sort of stuff thatwe would associate with life and yet from this noxious stew life formed Carbon dioxide is apowerful greenhouse gas This was a good thing because the Sun was significantly dimmer back then Had we not had the benefit of a greenhouse effect the Earth might well have frozen over permanently and life might never have gotten a toehold But somehow life did For the next million_years the young Earth continued to be pelted relentlessly by comets meteorites and other galactic debris which brought water to fill the oceans and the componentsnecessary for the successful formation of life It was a singularly hostile environment and yetsomehow life got going Some tiny bag of chemicals twitched and became animate We were on ourway Four billion years later people began to wonder how it had all happened And it is there that ourstory next takes us PART II THE SIZE OF THE EARTH THE MEASURE OF THINGSIF YOU HAD to select the least convivial scientific field trip of all time you could certainly doworse than the French Royal Academy of Sciences' Peruvian expedition of Led by ahydrologist named Pierre Bouguer and a soldier mathematician named Charles Marie de LaCondamine it was a party of scientists and adventurers who traveled to Peru with the purpose oftriangulating distances through the Andes At the time people had lately become infected with a powerful desire to understand the Earth todetermine how old it was and how massive where it hung in space and how it had come to be TheFrench party's goal was to help settle the question of the circumference of the planet by measuring thelength of one degree of meridian or of the distance around the planet along a line reachingfrom Yarouqui near Quito to just beyond Cuenca in what is now Ecuador a distance of about twohundred miles Almost at once things began to go wrong sometimes spectacularly so In Quito the visitorssomehow provoked the locals and were chased out of town by a mob armed with stones Soon after the expedition's doctor was murdered in a misunderstanding over a woman The botanist becamederanged Others died of fevers and falls The third most senior member of the party a man namedPierre Godin ran off with a thirteen year old girl and could not be induced to return At one point the group had to suspend work for eight months while La_Condamine rode off to Limato sort out a problem with their permits Eventually he and Bouguer stopped speaking and refused towork together Everywhere the dwindling party went it was met with the deepest suspicions fromofficials who found it difficult to believe that a group of French scientists would travel halfwayaround the world to measure the world That made no sense at all Two and a half centuries later itstill seems a reasonable question Why didn't the French make their measurements in France and savethemselves all the bother and discomfort of their Andean adventure The answer lies partly with the fact that eighteenth_century scientists the French in particular seldom did things simply if an absurdly demanding alternative was available and partly with apractical problem that had first arisen with the English astronomer Edmond Halley many years before long before Bouguer and La_Condamine dreamed of going to South_America much less had areason for doing so Halley was an exceptional figure In the course of a long and productive career he was a seacaptain a cartographer a professor of geometry at the University of Oxford deputy controller of theRoyal Mint astronomer royal and inventor of the deep sea diving bell He wrote authoritatively onmagnetism tides and the motions of the planets and fondly on the effects of opium He invented theweather map and actuarial table proposed methods for working out the age of the Earth and itsdistance from the Sun even devised a practical method for keeping fish fresh out of season The onething he didn't do interestingly enough was discover the comet that bears his name He merelyrecognized that the comet he saw in was the same one that had been seen by others in and It didn't become Halley's comet until some sixteen years after his death For all his achievements however Halley's greatest contribution to human knowledge may simplyhave been to take part in a modest scientific wager with two other worthies of his day Robert Hooke who is perhaps best remembered now as the first person to describe a cell and the great and statelySir Christopher Wren who was actually an astronomer first and architect second though that is notoften generally remembered now In Halley Hooke and Wren were dining in London when theconversation turned to the motions of celestial objects It was known that planets were inclined toorbit in a particular kind of oval known as an ellipse a very specific and precise curve to quoteRichard Feynman but it wasn't understood why Wren generously offered a prize worth fortyshillings equivalent to a couple of weeks' pay to whichever of the men could provide a solution Hooke who was well known for taking credit for ideas that weren't necessarily his own claimedthat he had solved the problem already but declined now to share it on the interesting and inventivegrounds that it would rob others of the satisfaction of discovering the answer for themselves Hewould instead conceal it for some time that others might know how to value it If he thought anymore on the matter he left no evidence of it Halley however became consumed with finding theanswer to the point that the following year he traveled to Cambridge and boldly called upon theuniversity's Lucasian Professor of Mathematics Isaac Newton in the hope that he could help Newton was a decidedly odd figure brilliant beyond measure but solitary joyless prickly to thepoint of paranoia famously distracted upon swinging his feet out of bed in the morning he wouldreportedly sometimes sit for hours immobilized by the sudden rush of thoughts to his head andcapable of the most riveting strangeness He built his own laboratory the first at Cambridge but thenengaged in the most bizarre experiments Once he inserted a bodkin a long needle of the sort usedfor sewing leather into his eye socket and rubbed it around betwixt my eye and the bone as near to the backside of my eye as I could just to see what would happen What happened miraculously was nothing at_least nothing lasting On another occasion he stared at the Sun for as long as hecould bear to determine what effect it would have upon his vision Again he escaped lasting damage though he had to spend some days in a darkened room before his eyes forgave him Set atop these odd beliefs and quirky traits however was the mind of a supreme genius thougheven when working in conventional channels he often showed a tendency to peculiarity As a student frustrated by the limitations of conventional mathematics he invented an entirely new form thecalculus but then told no one about it for twenty seven years In like manner he did work in opticsthat transformed our_understanding of light and laid the foundation for the science of spectroscopy and again chose not to share the results for three decades For all his brilliance real science accounted for only a part of his interests At least half hisworking life was given over to alchemy and wayward religious pursuits These were not meredabblings but wholehearted devotions He was a secret adherent of a dangerously heretical sectcalled Arianism whose principal tenet was the belief that there had been no Holy Trinity slightlyironic since Newton's college at Cambridge was Trinity He spent endless hours studying the floorplan of the lost Temple of King Solomon in Jerusalem teaching himself Hebrew in the process thebetter to scan original texts in the belief that it held mathematical clues to the dates of the secondcoming of Christ and the end of the world His attachment to alchemy was no less ardent In theeconomist John Maynard Keynes bought a trunk of Newton's papers at auction and discovered withastonishment that they were overwhelmingly preoccupied not with optics or planetary motions butwith a single minded quest to turn base metals into precious ones An analysis of a strand of Newton'shair in the s found it contained mercury an element of interest to alchemists hatters andthermometer makers but almost no one else at a concentration some forty times the natural level Itis perhaps little wonder that he had trouble remembering to rise in the morning Quite what Halley expected to get from him when he made his unannounced visit in August we can only guess But thanks to the later account of a Newton confidant Abraham DeMoivre we dohave a record of one of science's most historic encounters In Dr Halley came to visit at Cambridge and after they had some time together the Dr asked him what he thought the curve would be that would be described by the Planets supposingthe force of attraction toward the Sun to be reciprocal to the square of their distance from it This was a reference to a piece of mathematics known as the inverse square law which Halleywas convinced lay at the heart of the explanation though he wasn't sure exactly how Sir Isaac replied immediately that it would be an ellipse The Doctor struck with joy amazement asked him how he knew it Why ' saith he I have calculated it ' whereupon Dr Halley asked him for his calculation without farther delay Sir Isaac looked among his papersbut could not find it This was astounding like someone saying he had found a cure for cancer but couldn't rememberwhere he had put the formula Pressed by Halley Newton agreed to redo the calculations and producea paper He did as promised but then did much more He retired for two years of intensive reflectionand scribbling and at length produced his masterwork the Philosophiae Naturalis PrincipiaMathematica or Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy better known as the Principia Once in a great while a few times in history a human mind produces an observation so acute andunexpected that people can't quite decide which is the more amazing the fact or the thinking of it Principia was one of those moments It made Newton instantly famous For the rest of his life hewould be draped with plaudits and honors becoming among much else the first person in Britainknighted for scientific achievement Even the great German mathematician Gottfried von Leibniz withwhom Newton had a long bitter fight over priority for the invention of the calculus thought hiscontributions to mathematics equal to all the accumulated work that had preceded him Nearer thegods no mortal may approach wrote Halley in a sentiment that was endlessly echoed by hiscontemporaries and by many others since Although the Principia has been called one of the most inaccessible books ever written Newtonintentionally made it difficult so that he wouldn't be pestered by mathematical smatterers as hecalled them it was a beacon to those who could follow it It not only explained mathematically theorbits of heavenly bodies but also identified the attractive force that got them moving in the firstplace gravity Suddenly every motion in the universe made sense At Principia's heart were Newton's three laws of motion which state very baldly that a thingmoves in the direction in which it is pushed that it will keep moving in a straight line until some otherforce acts to slow or deflect it and that every action has an opposite and equal reaction and hisuniversal law of gravitation This states that every object in the universe exerts a tug on every other Itmay not seem like it but as you sit here now you are pulling everything around you walls ceiling lamp pet cat toward you with your own little indeed very little gravitational field And thesethings are also pulling on you It was Newton who realized that the pull of any two objects is to quoteFeynman again proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distancebetween them Put another way if you double the distance between two objects the attractionbetween them becomes four times weaker This can be expressed with the formulawhich is of course way beyond anything that most of us could make practical use of but at_least wecan appreciate that it is elegantly compact A couple of brief multiplications a simple division and bingo you know your gravitational position wherever you go It was the first really universal law ofnature ever propounded by a human mind which is why Newton is regarded with such universalesteem Principia's production was not without drama To Halley's horror just as work was nearingcompletion Newton and Hooke fell into dispute over the priority for the inverse square law andNewton refused to release the crucial third volume without which the first two made little sense Only with some frantic shuttle diplomacy and the most liberal applications of flattery did Halleymanage finally to extract the concluding volume from the erratic professor Halley's traumas were not yet quite over The Royal_Society had promised to publish the work butnow pulled out citing financial embarrassment The year before the society had backed a costly flopcalled The History of Fishes and they now suspected that the market for a book on mathematicalprinciples would be less than clamorous Halley whose means were not great paid for the book'spublication out of his own pocket Newton as was his custom contributed nothing To make mattersworse Halley at this time had just accepted a position as the society's clerk and he was informed thatthe society could no_longer afford to provide him with a promised salary of per annum He wasto be paid instead in copies of The History of Fishes Newton's laws explained so many things the slosh and roll of ocean tides the motions of planets why cannonballs trace a particular trajectory before thudding back to Earth why we aren't flung intospace as the planet spins beneath us at hundreds of miles an_hour that it took a while for all theirimplications to seep in But one revelation became almost immediately controversial This was the suggestion that the Earth is not quite round According to Newton's theory thecentrifugal force of the Earth's spin should result in a slight flattening at the poles and a bulging at theequator which would make the planet slightly oblate That meant that the length of a degree wouldn'tbe the same in Italy as it was in Scotland Specifically the length would shorten as you moved awayfrom the poles This was not good_news for those people whose measurements of the Earth werebased on the assumption that the Earth was a perfect sphere which was everyone For half a century people had been trying to work out the size of the Earth mostly by making veryexacting measurements One of the first such attempts was by an English mathematician namedRichard Norwood As a young_man Norwood had traveled to Bermuda with a diving bell modeled onHalley's device intending to make a fortune scooping pearls from the seabed The scheme failedbecause there were no pearls and anyway Norwood's bell didn't work but Norwood was not one towaste an experience In the early seventeenth century Bermuda was well known among ships' captainsfor being hard to locate The problem was that the ocean was big Bermuda small and thenavigational tools for dealing with this disparity hopelessly inadequate There wasn't even yet anagreed length for a nautical mile Over the breadth of an ocean the smallest miscalculations wouldbecome magnified so that ships often missed Bermuda sized targets by dismaying margins Norwood whose first love was trigonometry and thus angles decided to bring a little mathematical rigor tonavigation and to that end he determined to calculate the length of a degree Starting with his back against the Tower of London Norwood spent two devoted years marching miles north to York repeatedly stretching and measuring a length of chain as he went all thewhile making the most meticulous adjustments for the rise and fall of the land and the meanderings ofthe road The final step was to measure the angle of the Sun at York at the same time of day and on thesame day of the year as he had made his first measurement in London From this he reasoned he coulddetermine the length of one degree of the Earth's meridian and thus calculate the distance around thewhole It was an almost ludicrously ambitious undertaking a mistake of the slightest fraction of adegree would throw the whole thing out by miles but in fact as Norwood proudly declaimed hewas accurate to within a scantling or more precisely to within about six hundred yards In metricterms his figure worked out at kilometers per degree of arc In Norwood's masterwork of navigation The Seaman's Practice was published and foundan immediate following It went through seventeen editions and was still in print twenty_five yearsafter his death Norwood returned to Bermuda with his family becoming a successful planter anddevoting his leisure hours to his first love trigonometry He survived there for thirty eight years andit would be pleasing to report that he passed this span in happiness and adulation In_fact he didn't On the crossing from England his two young sons were placed in a cabin with the ReverendNathaniel White and somehow so successfully traumatized the young vicar that he devoted much ofthe rest of his career to persecuting Norwood in any small way he could think of Norwood's two daughters brought their father additional pain by making poor marriages One of thehusbands possibly incited by the vicar continually laid small charges against Norwood in court causing him much exasperation and necessitating repeated trips across Bermuda to defend himself Finally in the s witch trials came to Bermuda and Norwood spent his final years in severeunease that his papers on trigonometry with their arcane symbols would be taken as communicationswith the devil and that he would be treated to a dreadful execution So little is known of Norwoodthat it may in fact be that he deserved his unhappy declining years What is certainly true is that he gotthem Meanwhile the momentum for determining the Earth's circumference passed to France There theastronomer Jean Picard devised an impressively complicated method of triangulation involvingquadrants pendulum clocks zenith sectors and telescopes for observing the motions of the moons ofJupiter After two years of trundling and triangulating his way across France in he announced amore accurate measure of kilometers for one degree of arc This was a great source of pridefor the French but it was predicated on the assumption that the Earth was a perfect sphere whichNewton now said it was not To complicate matters after Picard's death the father and son team of Giovanni and Jacques Cassinirepeated Picard's experiments over a larger area and came up with results that suggested that theEarth was fatter not at the equator but at the poles that Newton in other words was exactly wrong It was this that prompted the Academy of Sciences to dispatch Bouguer and La_Condamine to SouthAmerica to take new measurements They chose the Andes because they needed to measure near the equator to determine if there reallywas a difference in sphericity there and because they reasoned that mountains would give them goodsightlines In_fact the mountains of Peru were so constantly lost in cloud that the team often had towait weeks for an hour's clear surveying On top of that they had selected one of the most nearlyimpossible terrains on Earth Peruvians refer to their landscape as muy accidentado muchaccidented and this it most certainly is The French had not only to scale some of the world's mostchallenging mountains mountains that defeated even their mules but to reach the mountains theyhad to ford wild rivers hack their way through jungles and cross miles of high stony desert nearlyall of it uncharted and far from any source of supplies But Bouguer and La_Condamine were nothingif not tenacious and they stuck to the task for nine and a half long grim sun blistered years Shortlybefore concluding the project they received word that a second French team taking measurements innorthern Scandinavia and facing notable discomforts of their own from squelching bogs todangerous ice floes had found that a degree was in fact longer near the poles as Newton hadpromised The Earth was forty three kilometers stouter when measured equatorially than whenmeasured from top to bottom around the poles Bouguer and La_Condamine thus had spent nearly a decade working toward a result they didn'twish to find only to learn now that they weren't even the first to find it Listlessly they completedtheir survey which confirmed that the first French team was correct Then still not speaking theyreturned to the coast and took separate ships home Something else conjectured by Newton in the Principia was that a plumb bob hung near a mountainwould incline very slightly toward the mountain affected by the mountain's gravitational mass as wellas by the Earth's This was more than a curious fact If you measured the deflection accurately andworked out the mass of the mountain you could calculate the universal gravitational constant that is the basic value of gravity known as G and along with it the mass of the Earth Bouguer and La_Condamine had tried this on Peru's Mount Chimborazo but had been defeated byboth the technical difficulties and their own squabbling and so the notion lay dormant for anotherthirty years until resurrected in England by Nevil Maskelyne the astronomer royal In Dava Sobel'spopular book Longitude Maskelyne is presented as a ninny and villain for failing to appreciate thebrilliance of the clockmaker John Harrison and this may be so but we are indebted to him in otherways not mentioned in her book not least for his successful scheme to weigh the Earth Maskelynerealized that the nub of the problem lay with finding a mountain of sufficiently regular shape to judgeits mass At his urging the Royal_Society agreed to engage a reliable figure to tour the British Isles to see ifsuch a mountain could be found Maskelyne knew just such a person the astronomer and surveyorCharles Mason Maskelyne and Mason had become friends eleven years earlier while engaged in aproject to measure an astronomical event of great importance the passage of the planet Venus acrossthe face of the Sun The tireless Edmond Halley had suggested years before that if you measured oneof these passages from selected points on the Earth you could use the principles of triangulation towork out the distance to the Sun and from that calibrate the distances to all the other bodies in thesolar system Unfortunately transits of Venus as they are known are an irregular occurrence They come in pairseight years apart but then are absent for a century or more and there were none in Halley's lifetime But the idea simmered and when the next transit came due in nearly two decades after Halley'sdeath the scientific world was ready indeed more ready than it had been for an astronomical eventbefore With the instinct for ordeal that characterized the age scientists set_off for more than a hundredlocations around the globe to Siberia China South Africa Indonesia and the woods of Wisconsin among many others France dispatched thirty two observers Britain eighteen more and still othersset out from Sweden Russia Italy Germany Ireland and elsewhere It was history's first cooperative international scientific venture and almost everywhere it ran intoproblems Many observers were waylaid by war sickness or shipwreck Others made theirdestinations but opened their crates to find equipment broken or warped by tropical heat Once againthe French seemed fated to provide the most memorably unlucky participants Jean Chappe spentmonths traveling to Siberia by coach boat and sleigh nursing his delicate instruments over everyperilous bump only to find the last vital stretch blocked by swollen rivers the result of unusuallyheavy spring rains which the locals were swift to blame on him after they saw him pointing strangeinstruments at the sky Chappe managed to escape with his life but with no useful measurements Unluckier still was Guillaume Le Gentil whose experiences are wonderfully summarized byTimothy Ferris in Coming of Age in the Milky_Way Le Gentil set_off from France a year ahead oftime to observe the transit from India but various setbacks left him still at sea on the day of the transit just about the worst place to be since steady measurements were impossible on a pitching ship Undaunted Le Gentil continued on to India to await the next transit in With eight years toprepare he erected a first rate viewing station tested and retested his instruments and had everythingin a state of perfect readiness On the morning of the second transit June he awoke to a fineday but just as Venus began its pass a cloud slid in front of the Sun and remained there for almostexactly the duration of the transit three hours fourteen minutes and seven seconds Stoically Le Gentil packed up his instruments and set_off for the nearest port but en route hecontracted dysentery and was laid up for nearly a year Still weakened he finally made it onto a ship It was nearly wrecked in a hurricane off the African coast When at last he reached home eleven anda half years after setting off and having achieved nothing he discovered that his relatives had hadhim declared dead in his absence and had enthusiastically plundered his estate In comparison the disappointments experienced by Britain's eighteen scattered observers were mild Mason found himself paired with a young surveyor named Jeremiah Dixon and apparently they gotalong well for they formed a lasting partnership Their instructions were to travel to Sumatra andchart the transit there but after just one night at sea their ship was attacked by a French frigate Although scientists were in an internationally cooperative mood nations weren't Mason and Dixonsent a note to the Royal_Society observing that it seemed awfully dangerous on the high seas andwondering if perhaps the whole thing oughtn't to be called off In reply they received a swift andchilly rebuke noting that they had already been paid that the nation and scientific community werecounting on them and that their failure to proceed would result in the irretrievable loss of theirreputations Chastened they sailed on but en route word reached them that Sumatra had fallen to theFrench and so they observed the transit inconclusively from the Cape of Good Hope On the wayhome they stopped on the lonely Atlantic outcrop of St Helena where they met Maskelyne whoseobservations had been thwarted by cloud cover Mason and Maskelyne formed a solid friendship andspent several happy and possibly even mildly useful weeks charting tidal flows Soon_afterward Maskelyne returned to England where he became astronomer royal and Masonand Dixon now evidently more seasoned set_off for four long and often perilous years surveyingtheir way through miles of dangerous American wilderness to settle a boundary dispute betweenthe estates of William Penn and Lord Baltimore and their respective colonies of Pennsylvania andMaryland The result was the famous Mason and Dixon line which later took on symbolic importanceas the dividing line between the slave and free states Although the line was their principal task theyalso contributed several astronomical surveys including one of the century's most accuratemeasurements of a degree of meridian an achievement that brought them far more acclaim inEngland than the settling of a boundary dispute between spoiled aristocrats Back in Europe Maskelyne and his counterparts in Germany and France were forced to theconclusion that the transit measurements of were essentially a failure One of the problems ironically was that there were too many observations which when brought together often provedcontradictory and impossible to resolve The successful charting of a Venusian transit fell instead to alittle known Yorkshire born sea captain named James Cook who watched the transit from asunny hilltop in Tahiti and then went on to chart and claim Australia for the British crown Upon hisreturn there was now enough information for the French astronomer Joseph Lalande to calculate thatthe mean distance from the Earth to the Sun was a little over million kilometers Two furthertransits in the nineteenth_century allowed astronomers to put the figure at million kilometers where it has remained ever_since The precise distance we now know is millionkilometers The Earth at last had a position in space As for Mason and Dixon they returned to England as scientific heroes and for reasons unknown dissolved their partnership Considering the frequency with which they turn up at seminal events ineighteenth century science remarkably little is known about either man No likenesses exist and fewwritten references Of Dixon the Dictionary of National_Biography notes intriguingly that he was said to have been born in a coal mine but then leaves it to the reader's imagination to supply aplausible explanatory circumstance and adds that he died at Durham in Apart from his nameand long association with Mason nothing more is known Mason is only slightly less shadowy We know that in at Maskelyne's behest he accepted thecommission to find a suitable mountain for the gravitational deflection experiment at length reportingback that the mountain they needed was in the central Scottish Highlands just above Loch Tay andwas called Schiehallion Nothing however would induce him to spend a summer surveying it Henever returned to the field again His next known movement was in when abruptly andmysteriously he turned up in Philadelphia with his wife and eight children apparently on the verge ofdestitution He had not been back to America since completing his survey there eighteen years earlierand had no known reason for being there or any friends or patrons to greet him A few weeks later hewas dead With Mason refusing to survey the mountain the job fell to Maskelyne So for four months in thesummer of Maskelyne lived in a tent in a remote Scottish glen and spent his days directing ateam of surveyors who took hundreds of measurements from every possible position To find themass of the mountain from all these numbers required a great_deal of tedious calculating for which amathematician named Charles Hutton was engaged The surveyors had covered a map with scores offigures each marking an elevation at some point on or around the mountain It was essentially just aconfusing mass of numbers but Hutton noticed that if he used a pencil to connect points of equalheight it all became much more orderly Indeed one could instantly get a sense of the overall shapeand slope of the mountain He had invented contour lines Extrapolating from his Schiehallion measurements Hutton calculated the mass of the Earth at million million tons from which could reasonably be deduced the masses of all the other majorbodies in the solar_system including the Sun So from this one experiment we learned the masses ofthe Earth the Sun the Moon the other planets and their moons and got contour lines into the bargain not bad for a summer's work Not everyone was satisfied with the results however The shortcoming of the Schiehallionexperiment was that it was not possible to get a truly accurate figure without knowing the actualdensity of the mountain For convenience Hutton had assumed that the mountain had the same densityas ordinary stone about times that of water but this was little more than an educated guess One improbable seeming person who turned his mind to the matter was a country parson namedJohn Michell who resided in the lonely Yorkshire village of Thornhill Despite his remote andcomparatively humble situation Michell was one of the great scientific thinkers of the eighteenthcentury and much esteemed for it Among a great_deal else he perceived the wavelike nature of earthquakes conducted much originalresearch into magnetism and gravity and quite extraordinarily envisioned the possibility of blackholes two hundred years before anyone else a leap of intuitive deduction that not even Newtoncould make When the German born musician William Herschel decided his real interest in life wasastronomy it was Michell to whom he turned for instruction in making telescopes a kindness forwhich planetary science has been in his debt ever_since But of all that Michell accomplished nothing was more ingenious or had greater impact than amachine he designed and built for measuring the mass of the Earth Unfortunately he died before hecould conduct the experiments and both the idea and the necessary equipment were passed on to abrilliant but magnificently retiring London scientist named Henry Cavendish Cavendish is a book in himself Born into a life of sumptuous privilege his grandfathers weredukes respectively of Devonshire and Kent he was the most gifted English scientist of his age butalso the strangest He suffered in the words of one of his few biographers from shyness to a degreebordering on disease Any human contact was for him a source of the deepest discomfort Once he opened his door to find an Austrian admirer freshly arrived from Vienna on the frontstep Excitedly the Austrian began to babble out praise For a few moments Cavendish received thecompliments as if they were blows from a blunt object and then unable to take any more fled downthe path and out the gate leaving the front door wide open It was some hours before he could becoaxed back to the property Even his housekeeper communicated with him by letter Although he did sometimes venture into society he was particularly devoted to the weeklyscientific soir es of the great naturalist Sir Joseph Banks it was always made clear to the otherguests that Cavendish was on no account to be approached or even looked at Those who sought hisviews were advised to wander into his vicinity as if by accident and to talk as it were into vacancy If their remarks were scientifically worthy they might receive a mumbled reply but more often thannot they would hear a peeved squeak his voice appears to have been high pitched and turn to find anactual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish fleeing for a more peaceful corner His wealth and solitary inclinations allowed him to turn his house in Clapham into a largelaboratory where he could range undisturbed through every corner of the physical sciences electricity heat gravity gases anything to do with the composition of matter The second half of theeighteenth century was a time when people of a scientific bent grew intensely interested in thephysical properties of fundamental things gases and electricity in particular and began seeingwhat they could do with them often with more enthusiasm than sense In America Benjamin Franklinfamously risked his life by flying a kite in an electrical storm In France a chemist named Pilatre deRozier tested the flammability of hydrogen by gulping a mouthful and blowing across an open flame proving at a stroke that hydrogen is indeed explosively combustible and that eyebrows are notnecessarily a permanent feature of one's face Cavendish for his part conducted experiments inwhich he subjected himself to graduated jolts of electrical current diligently noting the increasinglevels of agony until he could keep hold of his quill and sometimes his consciousness no_longer In the course of a long life Cavendish made a string of signal discoveries among much else hewas the first person to isolate hydrogen and the first to combine hydrogen and oxygen to form water but almost nothing he did was entirely divorced from strangeness To the continuing exasperation ofhis fellow scientists he often alluded in published work to the results of contingent experiments thathe had not told anyone about In his secretiveness he didn't merely resemble Newton but activelyexceeded him His experiments with electrical conductivity were a century ahead of their time butunfortunately remained undiscovered until that century had passed Indeed the greater part of what hedid wasn't known until the late nineteenth_century when the Cambridge physicist James ClerkMaxwell took on the task of editing Cavendish's papers by which time credit had nearly always beengiven to others Among much else and without telling anyone Cavendish discovered or anticipated the law of theconservation of energy Ohm's law Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures Richter's Law of ReciprocalProportions Charles's Law of Gases and the principles of electrical conductivity That's just some ofit According to the science historian J G Crowther he also foreshadowed the work of Kelvin andG H Darwin on the effect of tidal friction on slowing the rotation of the earth and Larmor'sdiscovery published in on the effect of local atmospheric cooling the work of Pickering onfreezing mixtures and some of the work of Rooseboom on heterogeneous equilibria Finally he leftclues that led directly to the discovery of the group of elements known as the noble gases some ofwhich are so elusive that the last of them wasn't found until But our interest here is inCavendish's last known experiment when in the late summer of at the age of sixty seven heturned his attention to the crates of equipment that had been left to him evidently out of simplescientific respect by John Michell When assembled Michell's apparatus looked like nothing so much as an eighteenth_century versionof a Nautilus weight training machine It incorporated weights counterweights pendulums shafts and torsion wires At the heart of the machine were two pound lead balls which were suspendedbeside two smaller spheres The idea was to measure the gravitational deflection of the smallerspheres by the larger ones which would allow the first measurement of the elusive force known asthe gravitational constant and from which the weight strictly speaking the mass of the Earth couldbe deduced Because gravity holds planets in orbit and makes falling objects land with a bang we tend to thinkof it as a powerful force but it is not really It is only powerful in a kind of collective sense whenone massive object like the Sun holds on to another massive object like the Earth At an elementallevel gravity is extraordinarily unrobust Each time you pick up a book from a table or a dime fromthe floor you effortlessly overcome the combined gravitational exertion of an entire planet WhatCavendish was trying to do was measure gravity at this extremely featherweight level Delicacy was the key word Not a whisper of disturbance could be allowed into the roomcontaining the apparatus so Cavendish took up a position in an adjoining room and made hisobservations with a telescope aimed through a peephole The work was incredibly exacting andinvolved seventeen delicate interconnected measurements which together took nearly a year tocomplete When at last he had finished his calculations Cavendish announced that the Earth weigheda little over pounds or six billion trillion metric_tons to use themodern measure A metric ton is kilograms or pounds Today scientists have at their disposal machines so precise they can detect the weight of a singlebacterium and so sensitive that readings can be disturbed by someone yawning seventy five feetaway but they have not significantly improved on Cavendish's measurements of The currentbest estimate for Earth's weight is billion trillion metric_tons a difference of only about percent from Cavendish's finding Interestingly all of this merely confirmed estimates made byNewton years before Cavendish without any experimental evidence at all So by the late eighteenth_century scientists knew very precisely the shape and dimensions of theEarth and its distance from the Sun and planets and now Cavendish without even leaving home hadgiven them its weight So you might think that determining the age of the Earth would be relativelystraightforward After all the necessary materials were literally at their feet But no Human beingswould split the atom and invent television nylon and instant coffee before they could figure out theage of their own planet To understand why we must travel north to Scotland and begin with a brilliant and genial man ofwhom few have ever heard who had just invented a new science called geology THE STONE BREAKERSAT JUST THE time that Henry Cavendish was completing his experiments in London four hundredmiles away in Edinburgh another kind of concluding moment was about to take place with the death ofJames Hutton This was bad_news for Hutton of course but good_news for science as it cleared theway for a man named John Playfair to rewrite Hutton's work without fear of embarrassment Hutton was by all accounts a man of the keenest insights and liveliest conversation a delight incompany and without rival when it came to understanding the mysterious slow processes that shapedthe Earth Unfortunately it was beyond him to set down his notions in a form that anyone could beginto understand He was as one biographer observed with an all but audible sigh almost entirelyinnocent of rhetorical accomplishments Nearly every line he penned was an invitation to slumber Here he is in his masterwork A Theory of the Earth with Proofs and Illustrations discussing something The world which we inhabit is composed of the materials not of the earth which was theimmediate predecessor of the present but of the earth which in ascending from the present weconsider as the third and which had preceded the land that was above the surface of the sea while our present land was yet beneath the water of the ocean Yet almost singlehandedly and quite brilliantly he created the science of geology and transformedour understanding of the Earth Hutton was born in into a prosperous Scottish family andenjoyed the sort of material comfort that allowed him to pass much of his life in a genially expansiveround of light work and intellectual betterment He studied medicine but found it not to his liking andturned instead to farming which he followed in a relaxed and scientific way on the family estate inBerwickshire Tiring of field and flock in he moved to Edinburgh where he founded asuccessful business producing sal ammoniac from coal soot and busied himself with variousscientific pursuits Edinburgh at that time was a center of intellectual vigor and Hutton luxuriated inits enriching possibilities He became a leading member of a society called the Oyster Club where hepassed his evenings in the company of men such as the economist Adam Smith the chemist JosephBlack and the philosopher David Hume as well as such occasional visiting sparks as BenjaminFranklin and James Watt In the tradition of the day Hutton took an interest in nearly everything from mineralogy tometaphysics He conducted experiments with chemicals investigated methods of coal mining andcanal building toured salt mines speculated on the mechanisms of heredity collected fossils andpropounded theories on rain the composition of air and the laws of motion among much else But hisparticular interest was geology Among the questions that attracted interest in that fanatically inquisitive age was one that hadpuzzled people for a very long time namely why ancient clamshells and other marine fossils wereso often found on mountaintops How on earth did they get there Those who thought they had asolution fell into two opposing camps One group known as the Neptunists was convinced thateverything on Earth including seashells in improbably lofty places could be explained by rising andfalling sea levels They believed that mountains hills and other features were as old as the Earthitself and were changed only when water sloshed over them during periods of global flooding Opposing them were the Plutonists who noted that volcanoes and earthquakes among otherenlivening agents continually changed the face of the planet but clearly owed nothing to waywardseas The Plutonists also raised awkward questions about where all the water went when it wasn't inflood If there was enough of it at times to cover the Alps then where pray was it during times oftranquility such as now Their belief was that the Earth was subject to profound internal forces aswell as surface ones However they couldn't convincingly explain how all those clamshells got upthere It was while puzzling over these matters that Hutton had a series of exceptional insights Fromlooking at his own farmland he could see that soil was created by the erosion of rocks and thatparticles of this soil were continually washed away and carried off by streams and rivers andredeposited elsewhere He realized that if such a process were carried to its natural conclusion thenEarth would eventually be worn quite smooth Yet everywhere around him there were hills Clearlythere had to be some additional process some form of renewal and uplift that created new hills andmountains to keep the cycle going The marine fossils on mountaintops he decided had not beendeposited during floods but had risen along with the mountains themselves He also deduced that itwas heat within the Earth that created new rocks and continents and thrust up mountain chains It is nottoo much to say that geologists wouldn't grasp the full implications of this thought for two hundredyears when finally they adopted plate_tectonics Above_all what Hutton's theories suggested was thatEarth processes required huge_amounts of time far more than anyone had ever dreamed There wereenough insights here to transform utterly our_understanding of the Earth In Hutton worked his ideas up into a long paper which was read at consecutive meetings ofthe Royal_Society of Edinburgh It attracted almost no notice at all It's not hard to see why Here inpart is how he presented it to his audience In the one case the forming cause is in the body which is separated for after the body has beenactuated by heat it is by the reaction of the proper matter of the body that the chasm whichconstitutes the vein is formed In the other case again the cause is extrinsic in relation to thebody in which the chasm is formed There has been the most violent fracture and divulsion butthe cause is still to seek and it appears not in the vein for it is not every fracture and dislocationof the solid body of our earth in which minerals or the proper substances of mineral veins arefound Needless to say almost no one in the audience had the faintest idea what he was talking_about Encouraged by his friends to expand his theory in the touching hope that he might somehow stumbleonto clarity in a more expansive format Hutton spent the next ten years preparing his magnum opus which was published in two volumes in Together the two books ran to nearly a thousand pages and were remarkably worse than even hismost pessimistic friends had feared Apart from anything_else nearly half the completed work nowconsisted of quotations from French sources still in the original French A third volume was sounenticing that it wasn't published until more than a century after Hutton's death and the fourthand concluding volume was never published at all Hutton's Theory of the Earth is a strong candidatefor the least read important book in science or at_least would be if there weren't so many others Even Charles Lyell the greatest geologist of the following century and a man who read everything admitted he couldn't get through it Luckily Hutton had a Boswell in the form of John Playfair a professor of mathematics at theUniversity of Edinburgh and a close friend who could not only write silken prose but thanks tomany years at Hutton's elbow actually understood what Hutton was trying to say most of the time In five years after Hutton's death Playfair produced a simplified exposition of the Huttonianprinciples entitled Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth The book was gratefullyreceived by those who took an active interest in geology which in was not a large number That however was about to change And how In the winter of thirteen like minded souls in London got together at the Freemasons Tavern atLong Acre in Covent Garden to form a dining club to be called the Geological_Society The ideawas to meet once a month to swap geological notions over a glass or two of Madeira and a convivialdinner The price of the meal was set at a deliberately hefty fifteen shillings to discourage thosewhose qualifications were merely cerebral It soon became apparent however that there was ademand for something more properly institutional with a permanent headquarters where peoplecould gather to share and discuss new findings In barely a decade membership grew to four_hundred still all gentlemen of course and the Geological was threatening to eclipse the Royal as thepremier scientific society in the country The members met twice a month from November until June when virtually all of them went off tospend the summer doing fieldwork These weren't people with a pecuniary interest in minerals youunderstand or even academics for the most part but simply gentlemen with the wealth and time toindulge a hobby at a more or less professional level By there were of them and the worldwould never see the like again It is hard to imagine now but geology excited the nineteenth_century positively gripped it in away that no science ever had before or would again In when Roderick Murchison publishedThe Silurian System a plump and ponderous study of a type of rock called greywacke it was aninstant bestseller racing through four editions even though it cost eight guineas a copy and was intrue Huttonian style unreadable As even a Murchison supporter conceded it had a total want ofliterary attractiveness And when in the great Charles Lyell traveled to America to give aseries of lectures in Boston sellout audiences of three thousand at a time packed into the LowellInstitute to hear his tranquilizing descriptions of marine zeolites and seismic perturbations inCampania Throughout the modern thinking world but especially in Britain men of learning ventured into thecountryside to do a little stone breaking as they called it It was a pursuit taken seriously and theytended to dress with appropriate gravity in top hats and dark suits except for the Reverend WilliamBuckland of Oxford whose habit it was to do his fieldwork in an academic gown The field attracted many extraordinary figures not least the aforementioned Murchison who spentthe first thirty or so years of his life galloping after foxes converting aeronautically challenged birdsinto puffs of drifting feathers with buckshot and showing no mental agility whatever beyond thatneeded to read The Times or play a hand of cards Then he discovered an interest in rocks andbecame with rather astounding swiftness a titan of geological thinking Then there was Dr James Parkinson who was also an early socialist and author of manyprovocative pamphlets with titles like Revolution without Bloodshed In he was implicatedin a faintly lunatic sounding conspiracy called the Pop gun Plot in which it was planned to shootKing George III in the neck with a poisoned dart as he sat in his box at the theater Parkinson washauled before the Privy Council for questioning and came within an ace of being dispatched in ironsto Australia before the charges against him were quietly dropped Adopting a more conservativeapproach to life he developed an interest in geology and became one of the founding members of theGeological Society and the author of an important geological text Organic Remains of a FormerWorld which remained in print for half a century He never caused trouble again Today however we remember him for his landmark study of the affliction then called the shaking palsy but knownever since as Parkinson's disease Parkinson had one other slight claim to fame In he becamepossibly the only person in history to win a natural_history museum in a raffle The museum inLondon's Leicester Square had been founded by Sir Ashton Lever who had driven himself bankruptwith his unrestrained collecting of natural wonders Parkinson kept the museum until when hecould no_longer support it and the collection was broken up and sold Not quite as remarkable in character but more influential than all the others combined was CharlesLyell Lyell was born in the year that Hutton died and only seventy miles_away in the village ofKinnordy Though Scottish by birth he grew up in the far south of England in the New Forest ofHampshire because his mother was convinced that Scots were feckless drunks As was generally thepattern with nineteenth_century gentlemen scientists Lyell came from a background of comfortablewealth and intellectual vigor His father also named Charles had the unusual distinction of being aleading authority on the poet Dante and on mosses Orthotricium lyelli which most visitors to theEnglish countryside will at some time have sat on is named for him From his father Lyell gained aninterest in natural_history but it was at Oxford where he fell under the spell of the Reverend WilliamBuckland he of the flowing gowns that the young Lyell began his lifelong devotion to geology Buckland was a bit of a charming oddity He had some real achievements but he is remembered atleast as much for his eccentricities He was particularly noted for a menagerie of wild animals somelarge and dangerous that were allowed to roam through his house and garden and for his desire toeat his way through every animal in creation Depending on whim and availability guests toBuckland's house might be served baked guinea pig mice in batter roasted hedgehog or boiledSoutheast Asian sea slug Buckland was able to find merit in them all except the common gardenmole which he declared disgusting Almost inevitably he became the leading authority on coprolites fossilized feces and had a table made entirely out of his collection of specimens Even when conducting serious science his manner was generally singular Once Mrs Bucklandfound herself being shaken awake in the middle of the night her husband crying in excitement Mydear I believe that Cheirotherium's footsteps are undoubtedly testudinal Together they hurried tothe kitchen in their nightclothes Mrs Buckland made a flour paste which she spread across the table while the Reverend Buckland fetched the family tortoise Plunking it onto the paste they goaded itforward and discovered to their delight that its footprints did indeed match those of the fossilBuckland had been studying Charles_Darwin thought Buckland a buffoon that was the word he used but Lyell appeared to find him inspiring and liked him well enough to go touring with him inScotland in It was soon_after this trip that Lyell decided to abandon a career in law and devotehimself to geology full time Lyell was extremely shortsighted and went through most of his life with a pained squint whichgave him a troubled air Eventually he would lose his sight altogether His other slight peculiaritywas the habit when distracted by thought of taking up improbable positions on furniture lyingacross two chairs at once or resting his head on the seat of a chair while standing up to quote hisfriend Darwin Often when lost in thought he would slink so low in a chair that his buttocks wouldall but touch the floor Lyell's only real job in life was as professor of geology at King's College inLondon from to It was around this time that he produced The Principles of Geology published in three volumes between and which in many ways consolidated andelaborated upon the thoughts first voiced by Hutton a generation earlier Although Lyell never readHutton in the original he was a keen student of Playfair's reworked version Between Hutton's day and Lyell's there arose a new geological controversy which largelysuperseded but is often confused with the old Neptunian Plutonian dispute The new battle becamean argument between catastrophism and uniformitarianism unattractive terms for an important andvery long running dispute Catastrophists as you might expect from the name believed that the Earthwas shaped by abrupt cataclysmic events floods principally which is why catastrophism andneptunism are often wrongly bundled together Catastrophism was particularly comforting to clericslike Buckland because it allowed them to incorporate the biblical flood of Noah into seriousscientific discussions Uniformitarians by contrast believed that changes on Earth were gradual andthat nearly all Earth processes happened slowly over immense spans of time Hutton was much morethe father of the notion than Lyell but it was Lyell most people read and so he became in mostpeople's minds then and now the father of modern geological thought Lyell believed that the Earth's shifts were uniform and steady that everything that had everhappened in the past could be explained by events still going on today Lyell and his adherents didn'tjust disdain catastrophism they detested it Catastrophists believed that extinctions were part of aseries in which animals were repeatedly wiped_out and replaced with new sets a belief that thenaturalist T_H_Huxley mockingly likened to a succession of rubbers of whist at the end of whichthe players upset the table and called for a new pack It was too convenient a way to explain theunknown Never was there a dogma more calculated to foster indolence and to blunt the keen edgeof curiosity sniffed Lyell Lyell's oversights were not inconsiderable He failed to explain convincingly how mountain rangeswere formed and overlooked glaciers as an agent of change He refused to accept Louis Agassiz'sidea of ice_ages the refrigeration of the globe as he dismissively termed it and was confidentthat mammals would be found in the oldest fossiliferous beds He rejected the notion that animalsand plants suffered sudden annihilations and believed that all the principal animal groups mammals reptiles fish and so on had coexisted since the dawn of time On all of these he wouldultimately be proved wrong Yet it would be nearly impossible to overstate Lyell's influence The Principles of Geology wentthrough twelve editions in Lyell's lifetime and contained notions that shaped geological thinking farinto the twentieth_century Darwin took a first edition with him on the Beagle voyage and wroteafterward that the great merit of the Principles was that it altered the whole tone of one's mind andtherefore that when seeing a thing never seen by Lyell one yet saw it partially through his eyes Inshort he thought him nearly a god as did many of his generation It is a testament to the strength ofLyell's sway that in the s when geologists had to abandon just a part of it to accommodate theimpact theory of extinctions it nearly killed them But that is another chapter Meanwhile geology had a great_deal of sorting out to do and not all of it went smoothly From theoutset geologists tried to categorize rocks by the periods in which they were laid down but therewere often bitter disagreements about where to put the dividing lines none more so than a longrunning debate that became known as the Great Devonian Controversy The issue arose when theReverend Adam Sedgwick of Cambridge claimed for the Cambrian_period a layer of rock thatRoderick Murchison believed belonged rightly to the Silurian The dispute raged for years and grewextremely heated De la Beche is a dirty dog Murchison wrote to a friend in a typical outburst Some sense of the strength of feeling can be gained by glancing through the chapter titles of MartinJ S Rudwick's excellent and somber account of the issue The Great Devonian Controversy Thesebegin innocuously enough with headings such as Arenas of Gentlemanly Debate and Unravelingthe Greywacke but then proceed on to The Greywacke Defended and Attacked Reproofs andRecriminations The Spread of Ugly Rumors Weaver Recants His Heresy Putting a Provincialin His Place and in case there was any doubt that this was war Murchison Opens the RhinelandCampaign The fight was finally settled in with the simple expedient of coming up with a newperiod the Ordovician to be inserted between the two Because the British were the most active in the early years British names are predominant in thegeological lexicon Devonian is of course from the English county of Devon Cambrian comes fromthe Roman name for Wales while Ordovician and Silurian recall ancient Welsh tribes theOrdovices and Silures But with the rise of geological prospecting elsewhere names began to creepin from all over Jurassic refers to the Jura Mountains on the border of France and Switzerland Permian recalls the former Russian province of Perm in the Ural Mountains For Cretaceous fromthe Latin for chalk we are indebted to a Belgian geologist with the perky name of J J d'Omaliusd'Halloy Originally geological history was divided into four spans of time primary secondary tertiary and quaternary The system was too neat to last and soon geologists were contributing additionaldivisions while eliminating others Primary and secondary fell out of use altogether while quaternarywas discarded by some but kept by others Today only tertiary remains as a common designationeverywhere even though it no_longer represents a third period of anything Lyell in his Principles introduced additional units known as epochs or series to cover the periodsince the age of the dinosaurs among them Pleistocene most recent Pliocene more recent Miocene moderately recent and the rather endearingly vague Oligocene but a little recent Lyell originally intended to employ synchronous for his endings giving us such crunchydesignations as Meiosynchronous and Pleiosynchronous The Reverend William Whewell aninfluential man objected on etymological grounds and suggested instead an eous pattern producing Meioneous Pleioneous and so on The cene terminations were thus something of acompromise Nowadays and speaking very generally geological time is divided first into four great chunksknown as eras Precambrian Paleozoic from the Greek meaning old life Mesozoic middlelife and Cenozoic recent life These four eras are further divided into anywhere from a dozento twenty subgroups usually called periods though sometimes known as systems Most of these arealso reasonably well known Cretaceous Jurassic Triassic Silurian and so on Then come Lyell's epochs the Pleistocene Miocene and so on which apply only to the mostrecent but paleontologically busy sixty five million_years and finally we have a mass of finersubdivisions known as stages or ages Most of these are named nearly always awkwardly afterplaces Illinoian Desmoinesian Croixian Kimmeridgian and so on in like vein Altogether according to John McPhee these number in the tens of dozens Fortunately unless you take upgeology as a career you are unlikely ever to hear any of them again Further confusing the matter is that the stages or ages in North_America have different names fromthe stages in Europe and often only roughly intersect in time Thus the North American Cincinnatianstage mostly corresponds with the Ashgillian stage in Europe plus a tiny bit of the slightly earlierCaradocian stage Also all this changes from textbook to textbook and from person to person so that some authoritiesdescribe seven recent epochs while others are content with four In some books too you will findthe tertiary and quaternary taken out and replaced by periods of different lengths called thePalaeogene and Neogene Others divide the Precambrian into two eras the very ancient Archean andthe more recent Proterozoic Sometimes too you will see the term Phanerozoic used to describe thespan encompassing the Cenozoic Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras Moreover all this applies only to units of time Rocks are divided into quite separate units knownas systems series and stages A distinction is also made between late and early referring to time and upper and lower referring to layers of rock It can all get terribly confusing to nonspecialists but to a geologist these can be matters of passion I have seen grown men glow incandescent withrage over this metaphorical millisecond in life's history the British paleontologist Richard Forteyhas written with regard to a long running twentieth_century dispute over where the boundary liesbetween the Cambrian and Ordovician At least today we can bring some sophisticated dating techniques to the table For most of thenineteenth century geologists could draw on nothing more than the most hopeful guesswork Thefrustrating position then was that although they could place the various rocks and fossils in order byage they had no idea how long any of those ages were When Buckland speculated on the antiquity ofan Ichthyosaurus skeleton he could do no better than suggest that it had lived somewhere between tenthousand or more than ten_thousand times ten_thousand years earlier Although there was no reliable way of dating periods there was no shortage of people willing totry The most well known early attempt was in when Archbishop James Ussher of the Church ofIreland made a careful study of the Bible and other historical sources and concluded in a hefty tomecalled Annals of the Old Testament that the Earth had been created at midday on October B C an assertion that has amused historians and textbook writers ever_since There is a persistent myth incidentally and one propounded in many serious books thatUssher's views dominated scientific beliefs well into the nineteenth_century and that it was Lyell whoput everyone straight Stephen_Jay Gould in Time's Arrow cites as a typical example this sentencefrom a popular_book of the s Until Lyell published his book most thinking people accepted theidea that the earth was young In_fact no As Martin J S Rudwick puts it No geologist of anynationality whose work was taken seriously by other geologists advocated a timescale confinedwithin the limits of a literalistic exegesis of Genesis Even the Reverend Buckland as pious a soulas the nineteenth_century produced noted that nowhere did the Bible suggest that God made Heavenand Earth on the first day but merely in the beginning That beginning he reasoned may have lasted millions_upon millions of years Everyone agreed that the Earth was ancient The question wassimply how ancient One of the better early attempts at dating the planet came from the ever reliable Edmond Halley who in suggested that if you divided the total amount of salt in the world's seas by the amountadded each year you would get the number of years that the oceans had been in existence whichwould give you a rough idea of Earth's age The logic was appealing but unfortunately no one knewhow much salt was in the sea or by how much it increased each year which rendered the experimentimpracticable The first attempt at measurement that could be called remotely scientific was made by theFrenchman Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon in the s It had long been known that theEarth radiated appreciable amounts of heat that was apparent to anyone who went down a coal mine but there wasn't any way of estimating the rate of dissipation Buffon's experiment consisted ofheating spheres until they glowed white hot and then estimating the rate of heat loss by touching them presumably very lightly at first as they cooled From this he guessed the Earth's age to besomewhere between and years_old This was of course a wild underestimate but aradical notion nonetheless and Buffon found himself threatened with excommunication for expressingit A practical man he apologized at once for his thoughtless heresy then cheerfully repeated theassertions throughout his subsequent writings By the middle of the nineteenth_century most learned people thought the Earth was at_least a fewmillion years_old perhaps even some tens of millions of years_old but probably not more than that So it came as a surprise when in in On the Origin of Species Charles_Darwin announced thatthe geological processes that created the Weald an area of southern England stretching across Kent Surrey and Sussex had taken by his calculations years to complete The assertion wasremarkable partly for being so arrestingly specific but even more for flying in the face of acceptedwisdom about the age of the Earth It proved so contentious that Darwin withdrew it from the thirdedition of the book The problem at its heart remained however Darwin and his geological friendsneeded the Earth to be old but no one could figure out a way to make it so Unfortunately for Darwin and for progress the question came to the attention of the great Lord Kelvin who though indubitably great was then still just plain William Thomson he wouldn't be elevated tothe peerage until when he was sixty eight years_old and nearing the end of his career but I shallfollow the convention here of using the name retroactively Kelvin was one of the most extraordinaryfigures of the nineteenth_century indeed of any century The German scientist Hermann vonHelmholtz no intellectual slouch himself wrote that Kelvin had by far the greatest intelligence andlucidity and mobility of thought of any man he had ever met I felt quite wooden beside himsometimes he added a bit dejectedly The sentiment is understandable for Kelvin really was a kind of Victorian superman He was bornin in Belfast the son of a professor of mathematics at the Royal Academical Institution whosoon after transferred to Glasgow There Kelvin proved himself such a prodigy that he was admittedto Glasgow University at the exceedingly tender age of ten By the time he had reached his earlytwenties he had studied at institutions in London and Paris graduated from Cambridge where hewon the university's top prizes for rowing and mathematics and somehow found time to launch amusical society as well been elected a fellow of Peterhouse and written in French and English adozen papers in pure and applied mathematics of such dazzling originality that he had to publish themanonymously for fear of embarrassing his superiors At the age of twenty two he returned to GlasgowUniversity to take up a professorship in natural philosophy a position he would hold for the nextfifty three years In the course of a long career he lived till and the age of eighty three he wrote papers accumulated patents from which he grew abundantly wealthy and gained renown in nearly everybranch of the physical sciences Among much else he suggested the method that led directly to theinvention of refrigeration devised the scale of absolute temperature that still bears his name inventedthe boosting devices that allowed telegrams to be sent across oceans and made innumerableimprovements to shipping and navigation from the invention of a popular marine compass to thecreation of the first depth sounder And those were merely his practical achievements His theoretical work in electromagnetism thermodynamics and the wave theory of light wasequally revolutionary He had really only one flaw and that was an inability to calculate thecorrect age of the Earth The question occupied much of the second half of his career but he nevercame anywhere near getting it right His first effort in for an article in a popular magazinecalled Macmillan's suggested that the Earth was million_years old but cautiously allowed that thefigure could be as low as million_years or as high as million With remarkable prudence heacknowledged that his calculations could be wrong if sources now unknown to us are prepared inthe great storehouse of creation but it was clear that he thought that unlikely With the passage of time Kelvin would become more forthright in his assertions and less correct He continually revised his estimates downward from a maximum of million_years to millionyears to million_years and finally in to a mere million_years Kelvin wasn't beingwillful It was simply that there was nothing in physics that could explain how a body the size of theSun could burn continuously for more than a few tens of millions of years at most without exhaustingits fuel Therefore it followed that the Sun and its planets were relatively but inescapably youthful The problem was that nearly all the fossil evidence contradicted this and suddenly in thenineteenth century there was a lot of fossil evidence SCIENCE RED IN TOOTH AND CLAWIN SOMEONE in New_Jersey exactly who now seems to be forgotten found an enormousthighbone sticking out of a stream bank at a place called Woodbury Creek The bone clearly didn'tbelong to any species of creature still alive certainly not in New_Jersey From what little is knownnow it is thought to have belonged to a hadrosaur a large duck billed dinosaur At the time dinosaurs were unknown The bone was sent to Dr Caspar Wistar the nation's leading anatomist who described it at ameeting of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia that autumn Unfortunately Wistarfailed completely to recognize the bone's significance and merely made a few cautious and uninspiredremarks to the effect that it was indeed a whopper He thus missed the chance half a century ahead ofanyone else to be the discoverer of dinosaurs Indeed the bone excited so little interest that it wasput in a storeroom and eventually disappeared altogether So the first dinosaur bone ever found wasalso the first to be lost That the bone didn't attract greater interest is more than a little puzzling for its appearance came ata time when America was in a froth of excitement about the remains of large ancient animals Thecause of this froth was a strange assertion by the great French naturalist the Comte de Buffon he ofthe heated spheres from the previous chapter that living_things in the New World were inferior innearly every way to those of the Old World America Buffon wrote in his vast and much esteemedHistoire Naturelle was a land where the water was stagnant the soil unproductive and the animalswithout size or vigor their constitutions weakened by the noxious vapors that rose from its rottingswamps and sunless forests In such an environment even the native Indians lacked virility Theyhave no beard or body hair Buffon sagely confided and no ardor for the female Theirreproductive organs were small and feeble Buffon's observations found surprisingly eager support among other writers especially thosewhose conclusions were not complicated by actual familiarity with the country A Dutchman namedComeille de Pauw announced in a popular work called Recherches Philosophiques sur lesAm ricains that native American males were not only reproductively unimposing but so lacking invirility that they had milk in their breasts Such views enjoyed an improbable durability and couldbe found repeated or echoed in European texts till near the end of the nineteenth_century Not surprisingly such aspersions were indignantly met in America Thomas Jefferson incorporateda furious and unless the context is understood quite bewildering rebuttal in his Notes on the Stateof Virginia and induced his New_Hampshire friend General John Sullivan to send twenty soldiersinto the northern woods to find a bull moose to present to Buffon as proof of the stature and majesty ofAmerican quadrupeds It took the men two weeks to track down a suitable subject The moose whenshot unfortunately lacked the imposing horns that Jefferson had specified but Sullivan thoughtfullyincluded a rack of antlers from an elk or stag with the suggestion that these be attached instead Whoin France after all would know Meanwhile in Philadelphia Wistar's city naturalists had begun to assemble the bones of a giantelephant like creature known at first as the great American incognitum but later identified not quitecorrectly as a mammoth The first of these bones had been discovered at a place called Big BoneLick in Kentucky but soon others were turning up all over America it appeared had once been thehome of a truly substantial creature one that would surely disprove Buffon's foolish Galliccontentions In their keenness to demonstrate the incognitum's bulk and ferocity the American naturalists appearto have become slightly carried away They overestimated its size by a factor of six and gave itfrightening claws which in fact came from a Megalonyx or giant ground sloth found nearby Ratherremarkably they persuaded themselves that the animal had enjoyed the agility and ferocity of thetiger and portrayed it in illustrations as pouncing with feline grace onto prey from boulders Whentusks were discovered they were forced into the animal's head in any number of inventive ways Onerestorer screwed the tusks in upside down like the fangs of a saber toothed cat which gave it asatisfyingly aggressive aspect Another arranged the tusks so that they curved backwards on theengaging theory that the creature had been aquatic and had used them to anchor itself to trees whiledozing The most pertinent consideration about the incognitum however was that it appeared to beextinct a fact that Buffon cheerfully seized upon as proof of its incontestably degenerate nature Buffon died in but the controversy rolled on In a selection of bones made their way toParis where they were examined by the rising star of paleontology the youthful and aristocraticGeorges Cuvier Cuvier was already dazzling people with his genius for taking heaps ofdisarticulated bones and whipping them into shapely forms It was said that he could describe thelook and nature of an animal from a single tooth or scrap of jaw and often name the species and genusinto the bargain Realizing that no one in America had thought to write a formal description of thelumbering beast Cuvier did so and thus became its official discoverer He called it a mastodon which means a touch unexpectedly nipple teeth Inspired by the controversy in Cuvier wrote a landmark paper Note on the Species ofLiving and Fossil Elephants in which he put forward for the first time a formal theory of extinctions His belief was that from time to time the Earth experienced global catastrophes in which groups ofcreatures were wiped_out For religious people including Cuvier himself the idea raiseduncomfortable implications since it suggested an unaccountable casualness on the part of Providence To what end would God create species only to wipe them out later The notion was contrary to thebelief in the Great Chain of Being which held that the world was carefully ordered and that everyliving thing within it had a place and purpose and always had and always would Jefferson for onecouldn't abide the thought that whole species would ever be permitted to vanish or come to that toevolve So when it was put to him that there might be scientific and political value in sending a partyto explore the interior of America beyond the Mississippi he leapt at the idea hoping the intrepidadventurers would find herds of healthy mastodons and other outsized creatures grazing on thebounteous plains Jefferson's personal secretary and trusted friend Meriwether Lewis was chosen coleader and chief naturalist for the expedition The person selected to advise him on what to look outfor with regard to animals living and deceased was none other than Caspar Wistar In the same year in fact the same month that the aristocratic and celebrated Cuvier waspropounding his extinction theories in Paris on the other side of the English Channel a rather moreobscure Englishman was having an insight into the value of fossils that would also have lastingramifications William Smith was a young supervisor of construction on the Somerset Coal Canal Onthe evening of January he was sitting in a coaching inn in Somerset when he jotted down thenotion that would eventually make his reputation To interpret rocks there needs to be some means ofcorrelation a basis on which you can tell that those carboniferous rocks from Devon are younger thanthese Cambrian rocks from Wales Smith's insight was to realize that the answer lay with fossils Atevery change in rock strata certain species of fossils disappeared while others carried on intosubsequent levels By noting which species appeared in which strata you could work out the relativeages of rocks wherever they appeared Drawing on his knowledge as a surveyor Smith began at onceto make a map of Britain's rock strata which would be published after many trials in and wouldbecome a cornerstone of modern geology The story is comprehensively covered in SimonWinchester's popular_book The Map That Changed the World Unfortunately having had his insight Smith was curiously uninterested in understanding why rockswere laid down in the way they were I have left off puzzling about the origin of Strata and contentmyself with knowing that it is so he recorded The whys and wherefores cannot come within theProvince of a Mineral Surveyor Smith's revelation regarding strata heightened the moral awkwardness concerning extinctions Tobegin with it confirmed that God had wiped_out creatures not occasionally but repeatedly This madeHim seem not so much careless as peculiarly hostile It also made it inconveniently necessary toexplain how some species were wiped_out while others continued unimpeded into succeeding eons Clearly there was more to extinctions than could be accounted for by a single Noachian deluge as theBiblical flood was known Cuvier resolved the matter to his own satisfaction by suggesting thatGenesis applied only to the most recent inundation God it appeared hadn't wished to distract oralarm Moses with news of earlier irrelevant extinctions So by the early years of the nineteenth_century fossils had taken on a certain inescapableimportance which makes Wistar's failure to see the significance of his dinosaur bone all the moreunfortunate Suddenly in any case bones were turning up all over Several other opportunities arosefor Americans to claim the discovery of dinosaurs but all were wasted In the Lewis and Clarkexpedition passed through the Hell Creek formation in Montana an area where fossil hunters wouldlater literally trip over dinosaur bones and even examined what was clearly a dinosaur boneembedded in rock but failed to make anything of it Other bones and fossilized footprints were foundin the Connecticut River Valley of New_England after a farm boy named Plinus Moody spied ancienttracks on a rock ledge at South Hadley Massachusetts Some of these at_least survive notably thebones of an Anchisaurus which are in the collection of the Peabody Museum at Yale Found in they were the first dinosaur bones to be examined and saved but unfortunately weren't recognized forwhat they were until In that same year Caspar Wistar died but he did gain a certainunexpected immortality when a botanist named Thomas Nuttall named a delightful climbing shrubafter him Some botanical purists still insist on spelling it wistaria By this time however paleontological momentum had moved to England In at Lyme Regis onthe Dorset coast an extraordinary child named Mary Anning aged eleven twelve or thirteen depending on whose account you read found a strange fossilized sea monster seventeen feet longand now known as the ichthyosaurus embedded in the steep and dangerous cliffs along the EnglishChannel It was the start of a remarkable career Anning would spend the next thirty five years gatheringfossils which she sold to visitors She is commonly held to be the source for the famous tonguetwister She sells seashells on the seashore She would also find the first plesiosaurus anothermarine monster and one of the first and best pterodactyls Though none of these was technically adinosaur that wasn't terribly relevant at the time since nobody then knew what a dinosaur was It wasenough to realize that the world had once held creatures strikingly unlike anything we might now find It wasn't simply that Anning was good at spotting fossils though she was unrivalled at that butthat she could extract them with the greatest delicacy and without damage If you ever have the chanceto visit the hall of ancient marine reptiles at the Natural_History_Museum in London I urge you to takeit for there is no other way to appreciate the scale and beauty of what this young woman achievedworking virtually unaided with the most basic tools in nearly impossible conditions The plesiosauralone took her ten years of patient excavation Although untrained Anning was also able to providecompetent drawings and descriptions for scholars But even with the advantage of her skills significant finds were rare and she passed most of her life in poverty It would be hard to think of a more overlooked person in the history of paleontology than MaryAnning but in fact there was one who came painfully close His name was Gideon Algernon Mantelland he was a country doctor in Sussex Mantell was a lanky assemblage of shortcomings he was vain self absorbed priggish neglectfulof his family but never was there a more devoted amateur paleontologist He was also lucky to havea devoted and observant wife In while he was making a house call on a patient in rural Sussex Mrs Mantell went for a stroll down a nearby lane and in a pile of rubble that had been left to fillpotholes she found a curious object a curved brown stone about the size of a small walnut Knowing her husband's interest in fossils and thinking it might be one she took it to him Mantellcould see at once it was a fossilized tooth and after a little study became certain that it was from ananimal that was herbivorous reptilian extremely large tens of feet long and from the Cretaceousperiod He was right on all counts but these were bold conclusions since nothing like it had beenseen before or even imagined Aware that his finding would entirely upend what was understood about the past and urged by hisfriend the Reverend William Buckland he of the gowns and experimental appetite to proceed withcaution Mantell devoted three painstaking years to seeking evidence to support his conclusions Hesent the tooth to Cuvier in Paris for an opinion but the great Frenchman dismissed it as being from ahippopotamus Cuvier later apologized handsomely for this uncharacteristic error One day whiledoing research at the Hunterian Museum in London Mantell fell into conversation with a fellowresearcher who told him the tooth looked very like those of animals he had been studying SouthAmerican iguanas A hasty comparison confirmed the resemblance And so Mantell's creature becameIguanodon after a basking tropical lizard to which it was not in any manner related Mantell prepared a paper for delivery to the Royal_Society Unfortunately it emerged that anotherdinosaur had been found at a quarry in Oxfordshire and had just been formally described by theReverend Buckland the very man who had urged him not to work in haste It was the Megalosaurus and the name was actually suggested to Buckland by his friend Dr James Parkinson the would beradical and eponym for Parkinson's disease Buckland it may be recalled was foremost a geologist and he showed it with his work on Megalosaurus In his report for the Transactions of theGeological Society of London he noted that the creature's teeth were not attached directly to thejawbone as in lizards but placed in sockets in the manner of crocodiles But having noticed this much Buckland failed to realize what it meant Megalosaurus was an entirely new type of creature Soalthough his report demonstrated little acuity or insight it was still the first published description of adinosaur and so to him rather than the far more deserving Mantell goes the credit for the discovery ofthis ancient line of beings Unaware that disappointment was going to be a continuing feature of his life Mantell continuedhunting for fossils he found another giant the Hylaeosaurus in and purchasing others fromquarrymen and farmers until he had probably the largest fossil collection in Britain Mantell was anexcellent doctor and equally gifted bone hunter but he was unable to support both his talents As hiscollecting mania grew he neglected his medical practice Soon fossils filled nearly the whole of hishouse in Brighton and consumed much of his income Much of the rest went to underwriting thepublication of books that few cared to own Illustrations of the Geology of Sussex published in sold only fifty copies and left him out of pocket an uncomfortably substantial sum forthe times In some desperation Mantell hit on the idea of turning his house into a museum and chargingadmission then belatedly realized that such a mercenary act would ruin his standing as a gentleman not to mention as a scientist and so he allowed people to visit the house for free They came in theirhundreds week after week disrupting both his practice and his home life Eventually he was forcedto sell most of his collection to pay off his debts Soon after his wife left him taking their fourchildren with her Remarkably his troubles were only just beginning In the district of Sydenham in south London at a place called Crystal Palace Park there stands astrange and forgotten sight the world's first life sized models of dinosaurs Not many people travelthere these days but once this was one of the most popular attractions in London in effect asRichard Fortey has noted the world's first theme park Quite a lot about the models is not strictlycorrect The iguanodon's thumb has been placed on its nose as a kind of spike and it stands on foursturdy legs making it look like a rather stout and awkwardly overgrown dog In life the iguanodondid not crouch on all fours but was bipedal Looking at them now you would scarcely guess thatthese odd and lumbering beasts could cause great rancor and bitterness but they did Perhaps nothingin natural_history has been at the center of fiercer and more enduring hatreds than the line of ancientbeasts known as dinosaurs At the time of the dinosaurs' construction Sydenham was on the edge of London and its spaciouspark was considered an ideal place to re erect the famous Crystal Palace the glass and cast ironstructure that had been the centerpiece of the Great Exhibition of and from which the new parknaturally took its name The dinosaurs built of concrete were a kind of bonus attraction On NewYear's Eve a famous dinner for twenty one prominent scientists was held inside the unfinishediguanodon Gideon Mantell the man who had found and identified the iguanodon was not amongthem The person at the head of the table was the greatest star of the young science of paleontology His name was Richard Owen and by this time he had already devoted several productive years tomaking Gideon Mantell's life hell Owen had grown up in Lancaster in the north of England where he had trained as a doctor Hewas a born anatomist and so devoted to his studies that he sometimes illicitly borrowed limbs organs and other parts from cadavers and took them home for leisurely dissection Once whilecarrying a sack containing the head of a black African sailor that he had just removed Owen slippedon a wet cobble and watched in horror as the head bounced away from him down the lane and throughthe open doorway of a cottage where it came to rest in the front parlor What the occupants had to sayupon finding an unattached head rolling to a halt at their feet can only be imagined One assumes thatthey had not formed any terribly advanced conclusions when an instant later a fraught looking youngman rushed in wordlessly retrieved the head and rushed out again In aged just twenty one Owen moved to London and soon_after was engaged by the RoyalCollege of Surgeons to help organize their extensive but disordered collections of medical andanatomical specimens Most of these had been left to the institution by John Hunter a distinguishedsurgeon and tireless collector of medical curiosities but had never been catalogued or organized largely because the paperwork explaining the significance of each had gone missing soon afterHunter's death Owen swiftly distinguished himself with his powers of organization and deduction At the sametime he showed himself to be a peerless anatomist with instincts for reconstruction almost on a parwith the great Cuvier in Paris He become such an expert on the anatomy of animals that he wasgranted first refusal on any animal that died at the London Zoological Gardens and these he wouldinvariably have delivered to his house for examination Once his wife returned home to find a freshlydeceased rhinoceros filling the front hallway He quickly became a leading expert on all kinds ofanimals living and extinct from platypuses echidnas and other newly discovered marsupials to thehapless dodo and the extinct giant birds called moas that had roamed New_Zealand until eaten out ofexistence by the Maoris He was the first to describe the archaeopteryx after its discovery in Bavariain and the first to write a formal epitaph for the dodo Altogether he produced some six hundredanatomical papers a prodigious output But it was for his work with dinosaurs that Owen is remembered He coined the term dinosauria in It means terrible lizard and was a curiously inapt name Dinosaurs as we now know weren'tall terrible some were no bigger_than rabbits and probably extremely retiring and the one thingthey most emphatically were not was lizards which are actually of a much older by thirty millionyears lineage Owen was well aware that the creatures were reptilian and had at his disposal aperfectly good Greek_word herpeton but for some reason chose not to use it Another moreexcusable error given the paucity of specimens at the time was that dinosaurs constitute not one buttwo orders of reptiles the bird hipped ornithischians and the lizard hipped saurischians Owen was not an attractive person in appearance or in temperament A photograph from his latemiddle years shows him as gaunt and sinister like the villain in a Victorian melodrama with long lank hair and bulging eyes a face to frighten babies In manner he was cold and imperious and hewas without scruple in the furtherance of his ambitions He was the only person Charles_Darwin wasever known to hate Even Owen's son who soon_after killed himself referred to his father's lamentable coldness of heart His undoubted gifts as an anatomist allowed him to get away with the most barefaced dishonesties In the naturalist T_H_Huxley was leafing through a new edition of Churchill's MedicalDirectory when he noticed that Owen was listed as Professor of Comparative Anatomy andPhysiology at the Government School of Mines which rather surprised Huxley as that was theposition he held Upon inquiring how Churchill's had made such an elemental error he was told thatthe information had been provided to them by Dr Owen himself A fellow naturalist named HughFalconer meanwhile caught Owen taking credit for one of his discoveries Others accused him ofborrowing specimens then denying he had done so Owen even fell into a bitter dispute with theQueen's dentist over the credit for a theory concerning the physiology of teeth He did not hesitate to persecute those whom he disliked Early in his career Owen used hisinfluence at the Zoological Society to blackball a young_man named Robert Grant whose only crimewas to have shown promise as a fellow anatomist Grant was astonished to discover that he wassuddenly denied access to the anatomical specimens he needed to conduct his research Unable topursue his work he sank into an understandably dispirited obscurity But no one suffered more from Owen's unkindly attentions than the hapless and increasingly tragicGideon Mantell After losing his wife his children his medical practice and most of his fossilcollection Mantell moved to London There in the fateful year in which Owen would achievehis greatest glory for naming and identifying the dinosaurs Mantell was involved in a terribleaccident While crossing Clapham Common in a carriage he somehow fell from his seat grewentangled in the reins and was dragged at a gallop over rough ground by the panicked horses Theaccident left him bent crippled and in chronic pain with a spine damaged beyond repair Capitalizing on Mantell's enfeebled state Owen set about systematically expunging Mantell'scontributions from the record renaming species that Mantell had named years before and claimingcredit for their discovery for himself Mantell continued to try to do original research but Owen usedhis influence at the Royal_Society to ensure that most of his papers were rejected In unable tobear any more pain or persecution Mantell took his own life His deformed spine was removed andsent to the Royal College of Surgeons where and now here's an irony for you it was placed in thecare of Richard Owen director of the college's Hunterian Museum But the insults had not quite finished Soon after Mantell's death an arrestingly uncharitableobituary appeared in the Literary Gazette In it Mantell was characterized as a mediocre anatomistwhose modest contributions to paleontology were limited by a want of exact knowledge Theobituary even removed the discovery of the iguanodon from him and credited it instead to Cuvier andOwen among others Though the piece carried no byline the style was Owen's and no one in theworld of the natural sciences doubted the authorship By this stage however Owen's transgressions were beginning to catch up with him His undoingbegan when a committee of the Royal_Society a committee of which he happened to be chairman decided to award him its highest honor the Royal Medal for a paper he had written on an extinctmollusc called the belemnite However as Deborah Cadbury notes in her excellent history of theperiod Terrible Lizard this piece of work was not quite as original as it appeared The belemnite it turned_out had been discovered four years earlier by an amateur naturalist named Chaning Pearce and the discovery had been fully reported at a meeting of the Geological_Society Owen had been atthat meeting but failed to mention this when he presented a report of his own to the Royal_Society in which not incidentally he rechristened the creature Belemnites owenii in his own honor AlthoughOwen was allowed to keep the Royal Medal the episode left a permanent tarnish on his reputation even among his few remaining supporters Eventually Huxley managed to do to Owen what Owen had done to so many others he had himvoted off the councils of the Zoological and Royal societies As a final insult Huxley became the newHunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons Owen would never again do important research but the latter half of his career was devoted to oneunexceptionable pursuit for which we can all be grateful In he became head of the naturalhistory section of the British Museum in which capacity he became the driving force behind thecreation of London's Natural_History_Museum The grand and beloved Gothic heap in SouthKensington opened in is almost entirely a testament to his vision Before Owen museums were designed primarily for the use and edification of the elite and eventhen it was difficult to gain access In the early days of the British Museum prospective visitors hadto make a written application and undergo a brief interview to determine if they were fit to beadmitted at all They then had to return a second time to pick up a ticket that is assuming they hadpassed the interview and finally come back a third time to view the museum's treasures Even thenthey were whisked through in groups and not allowed to linger Owen's plan was to welcomeeveryone even to the point of encouraging workingmen to visit in the evening and to devote most ofthe museum's space to public displays He even proposed very radically to put informative labels oneach display so that people could appreciate what they were viewing In this somewhatunexpectedly he was opposed by T_H_Huxley who believed that museums should be primarilyresearch institutes By making the Natural_History_Museum an institution for everyone Owentransformed our expectations of what museums are for Still his altruism in general toward his fellow man did not deflect him from more personalrivalries One of his last official acts was to lobby against a proposal to erect a statue in memory ofCharles Darwin In this he failed though he did achieve a certain belated inadvertent triumph Today his statue commands a masterly view from the staircase of the main hall in the Natural HistoryMuseum while Darwin and T_H_Huxley are consigned somewhat obscurely to the museum coffeeshop where they stare gravely over people snacking on cups of tea and jam doughnuts It would be reasonable to suppose that Richard Owen's petty rivalries marked the low point ofnineteenth century paleontology but in fact worse was to come this time from overseas In Americain the closing decades of the century there arose a rivalry even more spectacularly venomous if notquite as destructive It was between two strange and ruthless men Edward Drinker Cope and OthnielCharles Marsh They had much in common Both were spoiled driven self centered quarrelsome jealous mistrustful and ever unhappy Between them they changed the world of paleontology They began as mutual friends and admirers even naming fossil species after each other and spent apleasant week together in However something then went wrong between them nobody isquite sure what and by the following year they had developed an enmity that would grow intoconsuming hatred over the next thirty years It is probably safe to say that no two people in the naturalsciences have ever despised each other more Marsh the elder of the two by eight years was a retiring and bookish fellow with a trim beard anddapper manner who spent little time in the field and was seldom very good at finding things when hewas there On a visit to the famous dinosaur fields of Como Bluff Wyoming he failed to notice thebones that were in the words of one historian lying everywhere like logs But he had the means tobuy almost anything he wanted Although he came from a modest background his father was afarmer in upstate New_York his uncle was the supremely rich and extraordinarily indulgentfinancier George Peabody When Marsh showed an interest in natural_history Peabody had a museumbuilt for him at Yale and provided funds sufficient for Marsh to fill it with almost whatever took hisfancy Cope was born more directly into privilege his father was a rich Philadelphia businessman andwas by far the more adventurous of the two In the summer of in Montana while GeorgeArmstrong Custer and his troops were being cut down at Little Big Horn Cope was out hunting forbones nearby When it was pointed_out to him that this was probably not the most prudent time to betaking treasures from Indian lands Cope thought for a minute and decided to press on anyway Hewas having too good a season At one point he ran into a party of suspicious Crow Indians but hemanaged to win them over by repeatedly taking out and replacing his false teeth For a decade or so Marsh and Cope's mutual dislike primarily took the form of quiet sniping butin it erupted into grandiose dimensions In that year a Colorado schoolteacher named ArthurLakes found bones near Morrison while out hiking with a friend Recognizing the bones as comingfrom a gigantic saurian Lakes thoughtfully dispatched some samples to both Marsh and Cope Adelighted Cope sent Lakes a hundred dollars for his trouble and asked him not to tell anyone of hisdiscovery especially Marsh Confused Lakes now asked Marsh to pass the bones on to Cope Marshdid so but it was an affront that he would never forget It also marked the start of a war between the two that became increasingly bitter underhand andoften ridiculous They sometimes stooped to one team's diggers throwing rocks at the other team's Cope was caught at one point jimmying open crates that belonged to Marsh They insulted each otherin print and each poured scorn on the other's results Seldom perhaps never has science beendriven forward more swiftly and successfully by animosity Over the next several years the two menbetween them increased the number of known dinosaur species in America from to almost Nearly every dinosaur that the average person can name stegosaurus brontosaurus diplodocus triceratops was found by one or the other of them Unfortunately they worked in such recklesshaste that they often failed to note that a new discovery was something already known Between themthey managed to discover a species called Uintatheres anceps no fewer than twenty two times Ittook years to sort out some of the classification messes they made Some are not sorted out yet Of the two Cope's scientific legacy was much the more substantial In a breathtakingly industriouscareer he wrote some learned papers and described almost new species of fossil of alltypes not just dinosaurs more than double Marsh's output in both cases Cope might have doneeven more but unfortunately he went into a rather precipitate descent in his later years Havinginherited a fortune in he invested unwisely in silver and lost everything He ended_up living in asingle room in a Philadelphia boarding house surrounded by books papers and bones Marsh bycontrast finished his days in a splendid mansion in New Haven Cope died in Marsh two yearslater In his final years Cope developed one other interesting obsession It became his earnest wish to bedeclared the type specimen for Homo_sapiens that is that his bones would be the official set for thehuman race Normally the type specimen of a species is the first set of bones found but since no firstset of Homo_sapiens bones exists there was a vacancy which Cope desired to fill It was an odd andvain wish but no one could think of any grounds to oppose it To that end Cope willed his bones tothe Wistar Institute a learned society in Philadelphia endowed by the descendants of the seeminglyinescapable Caspar Wistar Unfortunately after his bones were prepared and assembled it was foundthat they showed signs of incipient syphilis hardly a feature one would wish to preserve in the typespecimen for one's own race So Cope's petition and his bones were quietly shelved There is still notype specimen for modern_humans As for the other players in this drama Owen died in a few years before Cope or Marsh Buckland ended_up by losing his mind and finished his days a gibbering wreck in a lunatic asylum inClapham not far from where Mantell had suffered his crippling accident Mantell's twisted spineremained on display at the Hunterian Museum for nearly a century before being mercifully obliteratedby a German bomb in the Blitz What remained of Mantell's collection after his death passed on to hischildren and much of it was taken to New_Zealand by his son Walter who emigrated there in Walter became a distinguished Kiwi eventually attaining the office of Minister of Native Affairs In he donated the prime specimens from his father's collection including the famous iguanodontooth to the Colonial Museum now the Museum of New_Zealand in Wellington where they haveremained ever_since The iguanodon tooth that started it all arguably the most important tooth inpaleontology is no_longer on display Of_course dinosaur hunting didn't end with the deaths of the great nineteenth_century fossil hunters Indeed to a surprising extent it had only just begun In the year that fell between the deaths ofCope and Marsh a trove greater by far than anything found before was discovered noticed really at a place called Bone Cabin Quarry only a few miles from Marsh's prime hunting ground at ComoBluff Wyoming There hundreds and hundreds of fossil bones were to be found weathering out of thehills They were so numerous in fact that someone had built a cabin out of them hence the name Injust the first two seasons pounds of ancient bones were excavated from the site and tens ofthousands of pounds more came in each of the half dozen years that followed The upshot is that by the turn of the twentieth_century paleontologists had literally tons of oldbones to pick over The problem was that they still didn't have any idea how old any of these boneswere Worse the agreed ages for the Earth couldn't comfortably support the numbers of eons and agesand epochs that the past obviously contained If Earth were really only twenty million_years old or so as the great Lord Kelvin insisted then whole orders of ancient creatures must have come into beingand gone out again practically in the same geological instant It just made no sense Other scientists besides Kelvin turned their minds to the problem and came up with results thatonly deepened the uncertainty Samuel Haughton a respected geologist at Trinity College in Dublin announced an estimated age for the Earth of million_years way beyond anything anybody elsewas suggesting When this was drawn to his attention he recalculated using the same data and put thefigure at million_years John Joly also of Trinity decided to give Edmond Halley's ocean saltsidea a whirl but his method was based on so many faulty assumptions that he was hopelessly adrift He calculated that the Earth was million_years old an age that fit neatly enough with Kelvin'sassumptions but unfortunately not with reality Such was the confusion that by the close of the nineteenth_century depending on which text youconsulted you could learn that the number of years that stood between us and the dawn of complexlife in the Cambrian_period was million million million million or billion orsome other number within that range As late as one of the most respected estimates by theAmerican George Becker put the Earth's age at perhaps as little as million_years Just when matters seemed most intractably confused along came another extraordinary figure witha novel approach He was a bluff and brilliant New_Zealand farm boy named Ernest Rutherford andhe produced pretty well irrefutable evidence that the Earth was at_least many hundreds of millions ofyears old probably rather more Remarkably his evidence was based on alchemy natural spontaneous scientifically credible and wholly non occult but alchemy nonetheless Newton it turned_out had not been so wrong afterall And exactly how that came to be is of course another story ELEMENTAL MATTERSCHEMISTRY AS AN earnest and respectable science is often said to date from when RobertBoyle of Oxford published The Sceptical Chymist the first work to distinguish between chemistsand alchemists but it was a slow and often erratic transition Into the eighteenth_century scholarscould feel oddly comfortable in both camps like the German Johann Becher who produced anunexceptionable work on mineralogy called Physica Subterranea but who also was certain that given the right materials he could make himself invisible Perhaps nothing better typifies the strange and often accidental nature of chemical science in itsearly days than a discovery made by a German named Hennig Brand in Brand becameconvinced that gold could somehow be distilled from human urine The similarity of color seems tohave been a factor in his conclusion He assembled fifty buckets of human urine which he kept formonths in his cellar By various recondite processes he converted the urine first into a noxious pasteand then into a translucent waxy substance None of it yielded gold of course but a strange andinteresting thing did happen After a time the substance began to glow Moreover when exposed toair it often spontaneously burst into flame The commercial potential for the stuff which soon became known as phosphorus from Greek andLatin roots meaning light bearing was not lost on eager businesspeople but the difficulties ofmanufacture made it too costly to exploit An ounce of phosphorus retailed for six guineas perhapsfive hundred dollars in today's_money or more than gold At first soldiers were called on to provide the raw material but such an arrangement was hardlyconducive to industrial scale production In the s a Swedish chemist named Karl or Carl Scheele devised a way to manufacture phosphorus in bulk without the slop or smell of urine It waslargely because of this mastery of phosphorus that Sweden became and remains a leading producerof matches Scheele was both an extraordinary and extraordinarily luckless fellow A poor pharmacist withlittle in the way of advanced apparatus he discovered eight elements chlorine fluorine manganese barium molybdenum tungsten nitrogen and oxygen and got credit for none of them In every case his finds were either overlooked or made it into publication after someone else had made the samediscovery independently He also discovered many useful compounds among them ammonia glycerin and tannic acid and was the first to see the commercial potential of chlorine as a bleach all breakthroughs that made other people extremely wealthy Scheele's one notable shortcoming was a curious insistence on tasting a little of everything heworked with including such notoriously disagreeable substances as mercury prussic acid another ofhis discoveries and hydrocyanic acid a compound so famously poisonous that years laterErwin Schr dinger chose it as his toxin of choice in a famous thought experiment see page Scheele's rashness eventually caught up with him In aged just forty three he was found dead athis workbench surrounded by an array of toxic chemicals any one of which could have accounted forthe stunned and terminal look on his face Were the world just and Swedish speaking Scheele would have enjoyed universal acclaim Instead credit has tended to lodge with more celebrated chemists mostly from the English speakingworld Scheele discovered oxygen in but for various heartbreakingly complicated reasonscould not get his paper published in a timely manner Instead credit went to Joseph Priestley whodiscovered the same element independently but latterly in the summer of Even moreremarkable was Scheele's failure to receive credit for the discovery of chlorine Nearly all textbooksstill attribute chlorine's discovery to Humphry Davy who did indeed find it but thirty six years afterScheele had Although chemistry had come a long way in the century that separated Newton and Boyle fromScheele and Priestley and Henry Cavendish it still had a long way to go Right up to the closing yearsof the eighteenth_century and in Priestley's case a little beyond scientists everywhere searched for and sometimes believed they had actually found things that just weren't there vitiated airs dephlogisticated marine acids phloxes calxes terraqueous exhalations and above all phlogiston the substance that was thought to be the active agent in combustion Somewhere in all this it wasthought there also resided a mysterious lan vital the force that brought inanimate objects to life Noone knew where this ethereal essence lay but two things seemed probable that you could enliven itwith a jolt of electricity a notion Mary Shelley exploited to full effect in her novel Frankenstein and that it existed in some substances but not others which is why we ended_up with two branches ofchemistry organic for those substances that were thought to have it and inorganic for those that didnot Someone of insight was needed to thrust chemistry into the modern age and it was the French whoprovided him His name was Antoine Laurent Lavoisier Born in Lavoisier was a member ofthe minor nobility his father had purchased a title for the family In he bought a practicingshare in a deeply despised institution called the Ferme G n rale or General Farm which collectedtaxes and fees on behalf of the government Although Lavoisier himself was by all accounts mild andfair minded the company he worked for was neither For one thing it did not tax the rich but only thepoor and then often arbitrarily For Lavoisier the appeal of the institution was that it provided himwith the wealth to follow his principal devotion science At his peak his personal earnings reached livres a year perhaps million in today's_money Three years after embarking on this lucrative career path he married the fourteen year olddaughter of one of his bosses The marriage was a meeting of hearts and minds both MadameLavoisier had an incisive intellect and soon was working productively alongside her husband Despite the demands of his job and busy social life they managed to put in five hours of science onmost days two in the early morning and three in the evening as well as the whole of Sunday which they called their jour de bonheur day of happiness Somehow Lavoisier also found the timeto be commissioner of gunpowder supervise the building of a wall around Paris to deter smugglers help found the metric system and coauthor the handbook M thode de Nomenclature Chimique which became the bible for agreeing on the names of the elements As a leading member of the Acad mie Royale des Sciences he was also required to take aninformed and active interest in whatever was topical hypnotism prison reform the respiration ofinsects the water supply of Paris It was in such a capacity in that Lavoisier made somedismissive remarks about a new theory of combustion that had been submitted to the academy by ahopeful young scientist The theory was indeed wrong but the scientist never forgave him His namewas Jean Paul Marat The one thing Lavoisier never did was discover an element At a time when it seemed as if almostanybody with a beaker a flame and some interesting powders could discover something new andwhen not incidentally some two_thirds of the elements were yet to be found Lavoisier failed touncover a single one It certainly wasn't for want of beakers Lavoisier had thirteen thousand of themin what was to an almost preposterous degree the finest private laboratory in existence Instead he took the discoveries of others and made sense of them He threw out phlogiston andmephitic airs He identified oxygen and hydrogen for what they were and gave them both their modernnames In short he helped to bring rigor clarity and method to chemistry And his fancy equipment did in fact come in very handy For years he and Madame Lavoisieroccupied themselves with extremely exacting studies requiring the finest measurements Theydetermined for_instance that a rusting object doesn't lose weight as everyone had long assumed butgains weight an extraordinary discovery Somehow as it rusted the object was attracting elementalparticles from the air It was the first realization that matter can be transformed but not eliminated Ifyou burned this book now its matter would be changed to ash and smoke but the net amount of stuffin the universe would be the same This became known as the conservation of mass and it was arevolutionary concept Unfortunately it coincided with another type of revolution the French one and for this one Lavoisier was entirely on the wrong side Not only was he a member of the hated Ferme G n rale but he had enthusiastically built the wallthat enclosed Paris an edifice so loathed that it was the first thing attacked by the rebelliouscitizens Capitalizing on this in Marat now a leading voice in the National Assembly denounced Lavoisier and suggested that it was well past time for his hanging Soon_afterward theFerme G n rale was shut down Not long after this Marat was murdered in his bath by an aggrievedyoung woman named Charlotte Corday but by this time it was too late for Lavoisier In the Reign of Terror already intense ratcheted up to a higher gear In October MarieAntoinette was sent to the guillotine The following month as Lavoisier and his wife were makingtardy plans to slip away to Scotland Lavoisier was arrested In May he and thirty one fellowfarmers general were brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal in a courtroom presided over by abust of Marat Eight were granted acquittals but Lavoisier and the others were taken directly to thePlace de la Revolution now the Place de la Concorde site of the busiest of French guillotines Lavoisier watched his father in law beheaded then stepped up and accepted his fate Less than threemonths later on July Robespierre himself was dispatched in the same way and in the same place and the Reign of Terror swiftly ended A hundred years after his death a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris and much admired untilsomeone pointed_out that it looked nothing like him Under questioning the sculptor admitted that hehad used the head of the mathematician and philosopher the Marquis de Condorcet apparently hehad a spare in the hope that no one would notice or having noticed would care In the secondregard he was correct The statue of Lavoisier cum Condorcet was allowed to remain in place foranother half century until the Second World_War when one morning it was taken away and melteddown for scrap In the early_s there arose in England a fashion for inhaling nitrous oxide or laughing gas after itwas discovered that its use was attended by a highly pleasurable thrilling For the next half centuryit would be the drug of choice for young people One learned body the Askesian Society was for atime devoted to little else Theaters put on laughing gas evenings where volunteers could refreshthemselves with a robust inhalation and then entertain the audience with their comical staggerings It wasn't until that anyone got around to finding a practical use for nitrous oxide as ananesthetic Goodness knows how many tens of thousands of people suffered unnecessary agoniesunder the surgeon's knife because no one thought of the gas's most obvious practical application I mention this to make the point that chemistry having come so far in the eighteenth_century ratherlost its bearings in the first decades of the nineteenth in much the way that geology would in the earlyyears of the twentieth Partly it was to do with the limitations of equipment there were for_instance no centrifuges until the second half of the century severely restricting many kinds of experiments and partly it was social Chemistry was generally speaking a science for businesspeople for thosewho worked with coal and potash and dyes and not gentlemen who tended to be drawn to geology natural_history and physics This was slightly less true in continental Europe than in Britain but onlyslightly It is perhaps telling that one of the most important observations of the century Brownianmotion which established the active nature of molecules was made not by a chemist but by a Scottishbotanist Robert Brown What Brown noticed in was that tiny grains of pollen suspended inwater remained indefinitely in motion no matter how long he gave them to settle The cause of thisperpetual motion namely the actions of invisible molecules was long a mystery Things might have been worse had it not been for a splendidly improbable character named Countvon Rumford who despite the grandeur of his title began life in Woburn Massachusetts in asplain Benjamin Thompson Thompson was dashing and ambitious handsome in feature and figure occasionally courageous and exceedingly bright but untroubled by anything so inconveniencing as ascruple At nineteen he married a rich widow fourteen years his senior but at the outbreak ofrevolution in the colonies he unwisely sided with the loyalists for a time spying on their behalf In thefateful year of facing arrest for lukewarmness in the cause of liberty he abandoned his wifeand child and fled just ahead of a mob of anti Royalists armed with buckets of hot tar bags offeathers and an earnest desire to adorn him with both He decamped first to England and then to Germany where he served as a military advisor to thegovernment of Bavaria so impressing the authorities that in he was named Count von Rumfordof the Holy Roman Empire While in Munich he also designed and laid out the famous park known asthe English Garden In between these undertakings he somehow found time to conduct a good deal of solid science Hebecame the world's foremost authority on thermodynamics and the first to elucidate the principles ofthe convection of fluids and the circulation of ocean currents He also invented several useful objects including a drip coffeemaker thermal underwear and a type of range still known as the Rumfordfireplace In during a sojourn in France he wooed and married Madame Lavoisier widow ofAntoine Laurent The marriage was not a success and they soon parted Rumford stayed on in France where he died universally esteemed by all but his former wives in But our purpose in mentioning him here is that in during a comparatively brief interlude inLondon he founded the Royal Institution yet another of the many learned societies that popped intobeing all over Britain in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries For a time it was almost theonly institution of standing to actively promote the young science of chemistry and that was thanksalmost entirely to a brilliant young_man named Humphry Davy who was appointed the institution'sprofessor of chemistry shortly after its inception and rapidly gained fame as an outstanding lecturerand productive experimentalist Soon after taking up his position Davy began to bang out new elements one after another potassium sodium magnesium calcium strontium and aluminum or aluminium depending on whichbranch of English you favor He discovered so many elements not so much because he was seriallyastute as because he developed an ingenious technique of applying electricity to a molten substance electrolysis as it is known Altogether he discovered a dozen elements a fifth of the known total ofhis day Davy might have done far more but unfortunately as a young_man he developed an abidingattachment to the buoyant pleasures of nitrous oxide He grew so attached to the gas that he drew on it literally three or four times a day Eventually in it is thought to have killed him Fortunately more sober types were at work elsewhere In a dour Quaker named John Daltonbecame the first person to intimate the nature of an atom progress that will be discussed morecompletely a little further on and in an Italian with the splendidly operatic name of LorenzoRomano Amadeo Carlo Avogadro Count of Quarequa and Cerreto made a discovery that wouldprove highly significant in the long term namely that two equal volumes of gases of any type if keptat the same pressure and temperature will contain identical numbers of molecules Two things were notable about Avogadro's Principle as it became known First it provided abasis for more accurately measuring the size and weight of atoms Using Avogadro's mathematics chemists were eventually able to work out for_instance that a typical atom had a diameter of centimeters which is very little indeed And second almost no one knew aboutAvogadro's appealingly simple principle for almost fifty years Partly this was because Avogadro himself was a retiring fellow he worked alone correspondedvery little with fellow scientists published few papers and attended no meetings but also it wasbecause there were no meetings to attend and few chemical journals in which to publish This is afairly extraordinary fact The Industrial Revolution was driven in large part by developments inchemistry and yet as an organized science chemistry barely existed for decades The Chemical Society of London was not founded until and didn't begin to produce a regularjournal until by which time most learned societies in Britain Geological Geographical Zoological Horticultural and Linnaean for naturalists and botanists were at_least twenty yearsold and often much more The rival Institute of Chemistry didn't come into being until a yearafter the founding of the American Chemical Society Because chemistry was so slow to getorganized news of Avogadro's important breakthrough of didn't begin to become general untilthe first international chemistry congress in Karlsruhe in Because chemists for so long worked in isolation conventions were slow to emerge Until wellinto the second half of the century the formula H_O might mean water to one chemist but hydrogenperoxide to another C H could signify ethylene or marsh gas There was hardly a molecule that wasuniformly represented everywhere Chemists also used a bewildering variety of symbols and abbreviations often self invented Sweden's J J Berzelius brought a much needed measure of order to matters by decreeing that theelements be abbreviated on the basis of their Greek or Latin names which is why the abbreviation foriron is Fe from the Latin ferrum and that for silver is Ag from the Latin argentum That so many ofthe other abbreviations accord with their English names N for nitrogen O for Oxygen H forhydrogen and so on reflects English's Latinate nature not its exalted status To indicate the numberof atoms in a molecule Berzelius employed a superscript notation as in H_O Later for no specialreason the fashion became to render the number as subscript H_O Despite the occasional tidyings up chemistry by the second half of the nineteenth_century was insomething of a mess which is why everybody was so pleased by the rise to prominence in of anodd and crazed looking professor at the University of St Petersburg named Dmitri IvanovichMendeleyev Mendeleyev also sometimes spelled Mendeleev or Mendel ef was born in at Tobolsk inthe far west of Siberia into a well educated reasonably prosperous and very large family so large in fact that history has lost track of exactly how many Mendeleyevs there were some sources saythere were fourteen children some say seventeen All agree at any rate that Dmitri was the youngest Luck was not always with the Mendeleyevs When Dmitri was small his father the headmaster of alocal school went blind and his mother had to go out to work Clearly an extraordinary woman sheeventually became the manager of a successful glass factory All went well until when thefactory burned down and the family was reduced to penury Determined to get her youngest child aneducation the indomitable Mrs Mendeleyev hitchhiked with young Dmitri four thousand miles to St Petersburg that's equivalent to traveling from London to Equatorial Guinea and deposited him atthe Institute of Pedagogy Worn out by her efforts she died soon_after Mendeleyev dutifully completed his studies and eventually landed a position at the local university There he was a competent but not terribly outstanding chemist known more for his wild hair andbeard which he had trimmed just once a year than for his gifts in the laboratory However in at the age of thirty five he began to toy with a way to arrange the elements Atthe time elements were normally grouped in two ways either by atomic weight using Avogadro'sPrinciple or by common properties whether they were metals or gases for_instance Mendeleyev'sbreakthrough was to see that the two could be combined in a single table As is often the way in science the principle had actually been anticipated three years previously byan amateur chemist in England named John Newlands He suggested that when elements werearranged by weight they appeared to repeat certain properties in a sense to harmonize at everyeighth place along the scale Slightly unwisely for this was an idea whose time had not quite yetcome Newlands called it the Law of Octaves and likened the arrangement to the octaves on a pianokeyboard Perhaps there was something in Newlands's manner of presentation but the idea wasconsidered fundamentally preposterous and widely mocked At gatherings droller members of theaudience would sometimes ask him if he could get his elements to play them a little tune Discouraged Newlands gave up pushing the idea and soon dropped from view altogether Mendeleyev used a slightly different approach placing his elements into groups of seven butemployed fundamentally the same principle Suddenly the idea seemed brilliant and wondrouslyperceptive Because the properties repeated themselves periodically the invention became known asthe periodic table Mendeleyev was said to have been inspired by the card game known as solitaire in North Americaand patience elsewhere wherein cards are arranged by suit horizontally and by number vertically Using a broadly similar concept he arranged the elements in horizontal rows called periods andvertical columns called groups This instantly showed one set of relationships when read up anddown and another when read from side to side Specifically the vertical columns put togetherchemicals that have similar properties Thus copper sits on top of silver and silver sits on top of goldbecause of their chemical affinities as metals while helium neon and argon are in a column made upof gases The actual formal determinant in the ordering is something called their electron valences for which you will have to enroll in night classes if you wish an understanding The horizontal rows meanwhile arrange the chemicals in ascending order by the number of protons in their nuclei whatis known as their atomic number The structure of atoms and the significance of protons will come in a following chapter so for themoment all that is necessary is to appreciate the organizing principle hydrogen has just one proton and so it has an atomic number of one and comes first on the chart uranium has ninety two protons and so it comes near the end and has an atomic number of ninety two In this sense as Philip Ball haspointed out chemistry really is just a matter of counting Atomic number incidentally is not to beconfused with atomic weight which is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons in a givenelement There was still a great_deal that wasn't known or understood Hydrogen is the most commonelement in the universe and yet no one would guess as much for another thirty years Helium thesecond most abundant element had only been found the year before its existence hadn't even beensuspected before that and then not on Earth but in the Sun where it was found with a spectroscopeduring a solar eclipse which is why it honors the Greek sun god Helios It wouldn't be isolated until Even so thanks to Mendeleyev's invention chemistry was now on a firm footing For most of us the periodic table is a thing of beauty in the abstract but for chemists it establishedan immediate orderliness and clarity that can hardly be overstated Without a doubt the PeriodicTable of the Chemical Elements is the most elegant organizational chart ever devised wrote RobertE Krebs in The History and Use of Our Earth's Chemical Elements and you can find similarsentiments in virtually every history of chemistry in print Today we have or so known elements ninety two naturally occurring ones plus a couple ofdozen that have been created in labs The actual number is slightly contentious because the heavy synthesized elements exist for only millionths of seconds and chemists sometimes argue over whetherthey have really been detected or not In Mendeleyev's day just sixty three elements were known butpart of his cleverness was to realize that the elements as then known didn't make a complete picture that many pieces were missing His table predicted with pleasing accuracy where new elementswould slot in when they were found No one knows incidentally how high the number of elements might go though anything beyond as an atomic weight is considered purely speculative but what is certain is that anything that isfound will fit neatly into Mendeleyev's great scheme The nineteenth_century held one last great surprise for chemists It began in when HenriBecquerel in Paris carelessly left a packet of uranium salts on a wrapped photographic plate in adrawer When he took the plate out some time later he was surprised to discover that the salts hadburned an impression in it just as if the plate had been exposed to light The salts were emitting raysof some sort Considering the importance of what he had found Becquerel did a very strange thing he turned thematter over to a graduate_student for investigation Fortunately the student was a recent migr fromPoland named Marie Curie Working with her new husband Pierre Curie found that certain kinds ofrocks poured out constant and extraordinary amounts of energy yet without diminishing in size orchanging in any detectable way What she and her husband couldn't know what no one could knowuntil Einstein explained things the following decade was that the rocks were converting mass intoenergy in an exceedingly efficient way Marie Curie dubbed the effect radioactivity In the processof their work the Curies also found two new elements polonium which they named after her nativecountry and radium In the Curies and Becquerel were jointly awarded the Nobel_Prize inphysics Marie Curie would win a second prize in chemistry in the only person to win in bothchemistry and physics At McGill University in Montreal the young New_Zealand born Ernest Rutherford becameinterested in the new radioactive materials With a colleague named Frederick Soddy he discoveredthat immense reserves of energy were bound up in these small amounts of matter and that theradioactive decay of these reserves could account for most of the Earth's warmth They alsodiscovered that radioactive elements decayed into other elements that one day you had an atom ofuranium say and the next you had an atom of lead This was truly extraordinary It was alchemy pureand simple no one had ever imagined that such a thing could happen naturally and spontaneously Ever the pragmatist Rutherford was the first to see that there could be a valuable practicalapplication in this He noticed that in any sample of radioactive material it always took the sameamount of time for half the sample to decay the celebrated half life and that this steady reliablerate of decay could be used as a kind of clock By calculating backwards from how much radiation amaterial had now and how swiftly it was decaying you could work out its age He tested a piece ofpitchblende the principal ore of uranium and found it to be million_years old very much olderthan the age most people were prepared to grant the Earth In the spring of Rutherford traveled to London to give a lecture at the Royal Institution theaugust organization founded by Count von Rumford only years before though that powdery andperiwigged age now seemed a distant eon compared with the roll your sleeves up robustness of thelate Victorians Rutherford was there to talk about his new disintegration theory of radioactivity aspart of which he brought out his piece of pitchblende Tactfully for the aging Kelvin was present ifnot always fully awake Rutherford noted that Kelvin himself had suggested that the discovery ofsome other source of heat would throw his calculations out Rutherford had found that other source Thanks to radioactivity the Earth could be and self evidently was much older than the twenty fourmillion years Kelvin's calculations allowed Kelvin beamed at Rutherford's respectful presentation but was in fact unmoved He never acceptedthe revised figures and to his dying day believed his work on the age of the Earth his most astute andimportant contribution to science far greater than his work on thermodynamics As with most scientific revolutions Rutherford's new findings were not universally accepted JohnJoly of Dublin strenuously insisted well into the s that the Earth was no more than eighty ninemillion years_old and was stopped only then by his own death Others began to worry that Rutherfordhad now given them too much time But even with radiometric dating as decay measurements becameknown it would be decades before we got within a billion years or so of Earth's actual age Sciencewas on the right track but still way out Kelvin died in That year also saw the death of Dmitri Mendeleyev Like Kelvin hisproductive work was far behind him but his declining years were notably less serene As he aged Mendeleyev became increasingly eccentric he refused to acknowledge the existence of radiation orthe electron or anything_else much that was new and difficult His final decades were spent mostlystorming out of labs and lecture halls all across Europe In element was namedmendelevium in his honor Appropriately notes Paul Strathern it is an unstable element Radiation of course went on and on literally and in ways nobody expected In the early sPierre Curie began to experience clear signs of radiation sickness notably dull aches in his bonesand chronic feelings of malaise which doubtless would have progressed unpleasantly We shallnever know for certain because in he was fatally run over by a carriage while crossing a Parisstreet Marie Curie spent the rest of her life working with distinction in the field helping to found thecelebrated Radium Institute of the University of Paris in Despite her two Nobel_Prizes she wasnever elected to the Academy of Sciences in large part because after the death of Pierre sheconducted an affair with a married physicist that was sufficiently indiscreet to scandalize even theFrench or at_least the old men who ran the academy which is perhaps another matter For a long time it was assumed that anything so miraculously energetic as radioactivity must bebeneficial For years manufacturers of toothpaste and laxatives put radioactive thorium in theirproducts and at_least until the late_s the Glen Springs Hotel in the Finger Lakes region of NewYork and doubtless others as well featured with pride the therapeutic effects of its Radioactivemineral springs Radioactivity wasn't banned in consumer products until By this time it wasmuch too late for Madame Curie who died of leukemia in Radiation in fact is so perniciousand long lasting that even now her papers from the s even her cookbooks are too dangerousto handle Her lab books are kept in lead lined boxes and those who wish to see them must donprotective clothing Thanks to the devoted and unwittingly high risk work of the first atomic scientists by the earlyyears of the twentieth_century it was becoming clear that Earth was unquestionably venerable thoughanother half century of science would have to be done before anyone could confidently say quite howvenerable Science meanwhile was about to get a new age of its own the atomic one PART III A NEW AGE DAWNS EINSTEIN'S UNIVERSEAS THE NINETEENTH century drew to a close scientists could reflect with satisfaction that theyhad pinned down most of the mysteries of the physical world electricity magnetism gases optics acoustics kinetics and statistical mechanics to name just a few all had fallen into order before them They had discovered the X ray the cathode ray the electron and radioactivity invented the ohm thewatt the Kelvin the joule the amp and the little erg If a thing could be oscillated accelerated perturbed distilled combined weighed or madegaseous they had done it and in the process produced a body of universal laws so weighty andmajestic that we still tend to write them out in capitals the Electromagnetic Field Theory of Light Richter's Law of Reciprocal Proportions Charles's Law of Gases the Law of Combining Volumes the Zeroth Law the Valence Concept the Laws of Mass Actions and others beyond counting Thewhole world clanged and chuffed with the machinery and instruments that their ingenuity hadproduced Many wise people believed that there was nothing much left for science to do In when a young German in Kiel named Max Planck was deciding whether to devote his lifeto mathematics or to physics he was urged most heartily not to choose physics because thebreakthroughs had all been made there The coming century he was assured would be one ofconsolidation and refinement not revolution Planck didn't listen He studied theoretical physics andthrew himself body and soul into work on entropy a process at the heart of thermodynamics whichseemed to hold much promise for an ambitious young_man In he produced his results andlearned to his dismay that the important work on entropy had in fact been done already in thisinstance by a retiring scholar at Yale University named J Willard Gibbs Gibbs is perhaps the most brilliant person that most people have never heard of Modest to thepoint of near invisibility he passed virtually the whole of his life apart from three years spentstudying in Europe within a three block area bounded by his house and the Yale campus in NewHaven Connecticut For his first ten years at Yale he didn't even bother to draw a salary He hadindependent means From when he joined the university as a professor to his death in his courses attracted an average of slightly over one student a semester His written work wasdifficult to follow and employed a private form of notation that many found incomprehensible Butburied among his arcane formulations were insights of the loftiest brilliance In Gibbs produced a series of papers collectively titled On the Equilibrium ofHeterogeneous Substances that dazzlingly elucidated the thermodynamic principles of well nearlyeverything gases mixtures surfaces solids phase changes chemical reactions electrochemical cells sedimentation and osmosis to quote William_H Cropper In essence whatGibbs did was show that thermodynamics didn't apply simply to heat and energy at the sort of largeand noisy scale of the steam engine but was also present and influential at the atomic level ofchemical reactions Gibbs's Equilibrium has been called the Principia of thermodynamics but forreasons that defy speculation Gibbs chose to publish these landmark observations in the Transactionsof the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences a journal that managed to be obscure even inConnecticut which is why Planck did not hear of him until too late Undaunted well perhaps mildly daunted Planck turned to other matters We shall turn tothese ourselves in a moment but first we must make a slight but relevant detour to Cleveland Ohio and an institution then known as the Case School of Applied Science There in the s a physicistof early middle years named Albert Michelson assisted by his friend the chemist Edward Morley embarked on a series of experiments that produced curious and disturbing results that would havegreat ramifications for much of what followed What Michelson and Morley did without actually intending to was undermine a longstandingbelief in something called the luminiferous ether a stable invisible weightless frictionless andunfortunately wholly imaginary medium that was thought to permeate the universe Conceived byDescartes embraced by Newton and venerated by nearly everyone ever_since the ether held aposition of absolute centrality in nineteenth_century physics as a way of explaining how light traveledacross the emptiness of space It was especially needed in the s because light andelectromagnetism were now seen as waves which is to say types of vibrations Vibrations must occurin something hence the need for and lasting devotion to an ether As late as the great Britishphysicist J J Thomson was insisting The ether is not a fantastic creation of the speculativephilosopher it is as essential to us as the air we breathe this more than four years after it waspretty incontestably established that it didn't exist People in short were really attached to the ether If you needed to illustrate the idea of nineteenth_century America as a land of opportunity youcould hardly improve on the life of Albert Michelson Born in on the German Polish border toa family of poor Jewish merchants he came to the United_States with his family as an infant and grewup in a mining camp in California's gold rush country where his father ran a dry goods business Toopoor to pay for college he traveled to Washington D C and took to loitering by the front door of theWhite House so that he could fall in beside President Ulysses S Grant when the President emergedfor his daily constitutional It was clearly a more innocent age In the course of these walks Michelson so ingratiated himself to the President that Grant agreed to secure for him a free place atthe U_S Naval Academy It was there that Michelson learned his physics Ten years later by now a professor at the Case School in Cleveland Michelson became interestedin trying to measure something called the ether drift a kind of head wind produced by movingobjects as they plowed through space One of the predictions of Newtonian physics was that thespeed of light as it pushed through the ether should vary with respect to an observer depending onwhether the observer was moving toward the source of light or away from it but no one had figuredout a way to measure this It occurred to Michelson that for half the year the Earth is traveling towardthe Sun and for half the year it is moving away from it and he reasoned that if you took careful enoughmeasurements at opposite seasons and compared light's travel time between the two you would haveyour answer Michelson talked Alexander Graham Bell newly enriched inventor of the telephone into providingthe funds to build an ingenious and sensitive instrument of Michelson's own devising called aninterferometer which could measure the velocity of light with great precision Then assisted by thegenial but shadowy Morley Michelson embarked on years of fastidious measurements The work wasdelicate and exhausting and had to be suspended for a time to permit Michelson a brief butcomprehensive nervous breakdown but by they had their results They were not at all what thetwo scientists had expected to find As Caltech astrophysicist Kip S Thorne has written The speed of light turned_out to be the samei n all directions and at all seasons It was the first hint in two hundred years in exactly twohundred years in fact that Newton's laws might not apply all the time everywhere The MichelsonMorley outcome became in the words of William_H Cropper probably the most famous negativeresult in the history of physics Michelson was awarded a Nobel_Prize in physics for the work thefirst American so honored but not for twenty years Meanwhile the Michelson Morley experimentswould hover unpleasantly like a musty smell in the background of scientific thought Remarkably and despite his findings when the twentieth_century dawned Michelson countedhimself among those who believed that the work of science was nearly at an end with only a fewturrets and pinnacles to be added a few roof bosses to be carved in the words of a writer inNature In_fact of course the world was about to enter a century of science where many people wouldn'tunderstand anything and none would understand everything Scientists would soon find themselvesadrift in a bewildering realm of particles and antiparticles where things pop in and out of existencein spans of time that make nanoseconds look plodding and uneventful where everything is strange Science was moving from a world of macrophysics where objects could be seen and held andmeasured to one of microphysics where events transpire with unimaginable swiftness on scales farbelow the limits of imagining We were about to enter the quantum age and the first person to push onthe door was the so far unfortunate Max Planck In now a theoretical physicist at the University of Berlin and at the somewhat advanced ageof forty two Planck unveiled a new quantum_theory which posited that energy is not a continuousthing like flowing water but comes in individualized packets which he called quanta This was anovel concept and a good one In the short term it would help to provide a solution to the puzzle ofthe Michelson Morley experiments in that it demonstrated that light needn't be a wave after all In thelonger term it would lay the foundation for the whole of modern physics It was at all events the firstclue that the world was about to change But the landmark event the dawn of a new age came in when there appeared in theGerman physics journal Annalen der Physik a series of papers by a young Swiss bureaucrat who hadno university affiliation no access to a laboratory and the regular use of no library greater than thatof the national patent office in Bern where he was employed as a technical examiner third class Anapplication to be promoted to technical examiner second class had recently been rejected His name was Albert Einstein and in that one eventful year he submitted to Annalen der Physikfive papers of which three according to C P Snow were among the greatest in the history ofphysics one examining the photoelectric effect by means of Planck's new quantum_theory one onthe behavior of small particles in suspension what is known as Brownian motion and one outlininga special theory of relativity The first won its author a Nobel_Prize and explained the nature of light and also helped to maketelevision possible among other things The second provided proof that atoms do indeed exist afact that had surprisingly been in some dispute The third merely changed the world Einstein was born in Ulm in southern Germany in but grew up in Munich Little in his earlylife suggested the greatness to come Famously he didn't learn to speak until he was three In the s his father's electrical business failing the family moved to Milan but Albert by now ateenager went to Switzerland to continue his education though he failed his college entrance examson the first try In he gave up his German citizenship to avoid military conscription and enteredthe Zurich Polytechnic Institute on a four year course designed to churn out high school scienceteachers He was a bright but not outstanding student In he graduated and within a few months was beginning to contribute papers to Annalen derPhysik His very first paper on the physics of fluids in drinking straws of all things appeared in thesame issue as Planck's quantum_theory From to he produced a series of papers onstatistical mechanics only to discover that the quietly productive J Willard Gibbs in Connecticut haddone that work as well in his Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics of At the same time he had fallen in love with a fellow student a Hungarian named Mileva Maric In they had a child out of wedlock a daughter who was discreetly put up for adoption Einsteinnever saw his child Two years later he and Maric were married In between these events in Einstein took a job with the Swiss patent office where he stayed for the next seven years He enjoyedthe work it was challenging enough to engage his mind but not so challenging as to distract him fromhis physics This was the background against which he produced the special theory of relativity in Called On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies it is one of the most extraordinary scientificpapers ever published as much for how it was presented as for what it said It had no footnotes orcitations contained almost no mathematics made no mention of any work that had influenced orpreceded it and acknowledged the help of just one individual a colleague at the patent office namedMichele Besso It was wrote C P Snow as if Einstein had reached the conclusions by purethought unaided without listening to the opinions of others To a surprisingly large extent that isprecisely what he had done His famous equation E_mc did not appear with the paper but came in a brief supplement thatfollowed a few months later As you will recall from school days E in the equation stands for energy m for mass and c for the speed of light squared In simplest terms what the equation says is that mass and energy have an equivalence They aretwo forms of the same thing energy is liberated matter matter is energy waiting to happen Since c the speed of light times itself is a truly enormous number what the equation is saying is that there isa huge amount a really huge amount of energy bound up in every material thing You may not feel outstandingly robust but if you are an average sized adult you will contain withinyour modest frame no less than x joules of potential energy enough to explode with the forceof thirty very large hydrogen bombs assuming you knew how to liberate it and really wished to makea point Everything has this kind of energy trapped within it We're just not very good at getting it out Even a uranium bomb the most energetic thing we have produced yet releases less than percentof the energy it could release if only we were more cunning Among much else Einstein's theory explained how radiation worked how a lump of uranium couldthrow out constant streams of high level energy without melting away like an ice cube It could do itby converting mass to energy extremely efficiently la E_mc It explained how stars could burn forbillions of years without racing through their fuel Ditto At a stroke in a simple formula Einsteinendowed geologists and astronomers with the luxury of billions of years Above_all the specialtheory showed that the speed of light was constant and supreme Nothing could overtake it It broughtlight no pun intended exactly to the very heart of our_understanding of the nature of the universe Not incidentally it also solved the problem of the luminiferous ether by making it clear that it didn'texist Einstein gave us a universe that didn't need it Physicists as a rule are not overattentive to the pronouncements of Swiss patent office clerks andso despite the abundance of useful tidings Einstein's papers attracted little notice Having just solvedseveral of the deepest mysteries of the universe Einstein applied for a job as a university lecturer andwas rejected and then as a high school teacher and was rejected there as well So he went back to hisjob as an examiner third class but of course he kept thinking He hadn't even come close to finishingyet When the poet Paul Val ry once asked Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas Einsteinlooked at him with mild but genuine surprise Oh that's not necessary he replied It's so seldom Ihave one I need hardly point out that when he did get one it tended to be good Einstein's next ideawas one of the greatest that anyone has ever had indeed the very greatest according to Boorse Motz and Weaver in their thoughtful history of atomic science As the creation of a single mind they write it is undoubtedly the highest intellectual achievement of humanity which is of course asgood as a compliment can get In or so it has sometimes been written Albert Einstein saw a workman fall off a roof andbegan to think about gravity Alas like many good stories this one appears to be apocryphal According to Einstein himself he was simply sitting in a chair when the problem of gravity occurredto him Actually what occurred to Einstein was something more like the beginning of a solution to theproblem of gravity since it had been evident to him from the outset that one thing missing from thespecial theory was gravity What was special about the special theory was that it dealt with thingsmoving in an essentially unimpeded state But what happened when a thing in motion light aboveall encountered an obstacle such as gravity It was a question that would occupy his thoughts formost of the next decade and lead to the publication in early of a paper entitled CosmologicalConsiderations on the General Theory of Relativity The special theory of relativity of was aprofound and important piece of work of course but as C P Snow once observed if Einstein hadn'tthought of it when he did someone else would have probably within five years it was an ideawaiting to happen But the general theory was something else altogether Without it wrote Snow in it is likely that we should still be waiting for the theory today With his pipe genially self effacing manner and electrified hair Einstein was too splendid afigure to remain permanently obscure and in the war over the world suddenly discovered him Almost at once his theories of relativity developed a reputation for being impossible for an ordinaryperson to grasp Matters were not helped as David Bodanis points out in his superb book E_mc when the New_York_Times decided to do a story and for reasons that can never fail to excitewonder sent the paper's golfing correspondent one Henry Crouch to conduct the interview Crouch was hopelessly out of his depth and got nearly everything wrong Among the more lastingerrors in his report was the assertion that Einstein had found a publisher daring enough to publish abook that only twelve men in all the world could comprehend There was no such book no suchpublisher no such circle of learned men but the notion stuck anyway Soon the number of people whocould grasp relativity had been reduced even further in the popular imagination and the scientificestablishment it must be said did little to disturb the myth When a journalist asked the British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington if it was true that he was oneof only three people in the world who could understand Einstein's relativity theories Eddingtonconsidered deeply for a moment and replied I_am trying to think who the third person is In_fact theproblem with relativity wasn't that it involved a lot of differential equations Lorentz transformations and other complicated mathematics though it did even Einstein needed help with some of it butthat it was just so thoroughly nonintuitive In essence what relativity says is that space and time are not absolute but relative to both theobserver and to the thing being observed and the faster one moves the more pronounced these effectsbecome We can never accelerate ourselves to the speed of light and the harder we try and faster wego the more distorted we will become relative to an outside observer Almost at once popularizers of science tried to come up with ways to make these conceptsaccessible to a general audience One of the more successful attempts commercially at_least wasThe ABC of Relativity by the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell In it Russellemployed an image that has been used many times since He asked the reader to envision a train onehundred yards long moving at percent of the speed of light To someone standing on a platformwatching it pass the train would appear to be only eighty yards long and everything on it would besimilarly compressed If we could hear the passengers on the train speak their voices would soundslurred and sluggish like a record played at too slow a speed and their movements would appearsimilarly ponderous Even the clocks on the train would seem to be running at only four fifths of theirnormal speed However and here's the thing people on the train would have no sense of these distortions Tothem everything on the train would seem quite normal It would be we on the platform who lookedweirdly compressed and slowed down It is all to do you see with your position relative to themoving object This effect actually happens every time you move Fly across the United_States and you will stepfrom the plane a quinzillionth of a second or something younger than those you left_behind Even inwalking across the room you will very slightly alter your own experience of time and space It hasbeen calculated that a baseball thrown at a hundred miles an_hour will pick up grams of mass on its way to home plate So the effects of relativity are real and have been measured The problem is that such changes are much too small to make the tiniest detectable difference to us But for other things in the universe light gravity the universe itself these are matters ofconsequence So if the ideas of relativity seem weird it is only because we don't experience these sorts ofinteractions in normal life However to turn to Bodanis again we all commonly encounter otherkinds of relativity for_instance with regard to sound If you are in a park and someone is playingannoying music you know that if you move to a more distant spot the music will seem quieter That'snot because the music is quieter of course but simply that your position relative to it has changed Tosomething too small or sluggish to duplicate this experience a snail say the idea that a boom boxcould seem to two observers to produce two different volumes of music simultaneously might seemincredible The most challenging and nonintuitive of all the concepts in the general theory of relativity is theidea that time is part of space Our instinct is to regard time as eternal absolute immutable nothingcan disturb its steady tick In_fact according to Einstein time is variable and ever changing It evenhas shape It is bound up inextricably interconnected in Stephen Hawking's expression with thethree dimensions of space in a curious dimension known as spacetime Spacetime is usually explained by asking you to imagine something flat but pliant a mattress say or a sheet of stretched rubber on which is resting a heavy round object such as an iron ball Theweight of the iron ball causes the material on which it is sitting to stretch and sag slightly This isroughly analogous to the effect that a massive object such as the Sun the iron ball has on spacetime the material it stretches and curves and warps it Now if you roll a smaller ball across the sheet ittries to go in a straight line as required by Newton's laws of motion but as it nears the massive objectand the slope of the sagging fabric it rolls downward ineluctably drawn to the more massive object This is gravity a product of the bending of spacetime Every object that has mass creates a little depression in the fabric of the cosmos Thus the universe as Dennis Overbye has put it is the ultimate sagging mattress Gravity on this view is no_longer somuch a thing as an outcome not a force' but a byproduct of the warping of spacetime in thewords of the physicist Michio Kaku who goes on In some sense gravity does not exist what movesthe planets and stars is the distortion of space and time Of_course the sagging mattress analogy can take us only so far because it doesn't incorporate theeffect of time But then our brains can take us only so far because it is so nearly impossible toenvision a dimension comprising three parts space to one part time all interwoven like the threads ina plaid fabric At all events I think we can agree that this was an awfully big thought for a young manstaring out the window of a patent office in the capital of Switzerland Among much else Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested that the universe must be eitherexpanding or contracting But Einstein was not a cosmologist and he accepted the prevailing wisdomthat the universe was fixed and eternal More or less reflexively he dropped into his equationssomething called the cosmological constant which arbitrarily counterbalanced the effects of gravity serving as a kind of mathematical pause button Books on the history of science always forgiveEinstein this lapse but it was actually a fairly appalling piece of science and he knew it He called it the biggest blunder of my life Coincidentally at about the time that Einstein was affixing a cosmological constant to his theory atthe Lowell Observatory in Arizona an astronomer with the cheerily intergalactic name of VestoSlipher who was in fact from Indiana was taking spectrographic readings of distant stars anddiscovering that they appeared to be moving away from us The universe wasn't static The starsSlipher looked at showed unmistakable signs of a Doppler shift the same mechanism behind thatdistinctive stretched out yee yummm sound cars make as they flash past on a racetrack Thephenomenon also applies to light and in the case of receding galaxies it is known as a red shift because light moving away from us shifts toward the red end of the spectrum approaching light shiftsto blue Slipher was the first to notice this effect with light and to realize its potential importance forunderstanding the motions of the cosmos Unfortunately no one much noticed him The LowellObservatory as you will recall was a bit of an oddity thanks to Percival Lowell's obsession withMartian canals which in the s made it in every sense an outpost of astronomical endeavor Slipher was unaware of Einstein's theory of relativity and the world was equally unaware of Slipher So his finding had no impact Glory instead would pass to a large mass of ego named Edwin Hubble Hubble was born in ten years after Einstein in a small Missouri town on the edge of the Ozarks and grew up there and inWheaton Illinois a suburb of Chicago His father was a successful insurance executive so life wasalways comfortable and Edwin enjoyed a wealth of physical endowments too He was a strong andgifted athlete charming smart and immensely good looking handsome almost to a fault in thedescription of William_H Cropper an Adonis in the words of another admirer According to hisown accounts he also managed to fit into his life more or less constant acts of valor rescuingdrowning swimmers leading frightened men to safety across the battlefields of France embarrassingworld champion boxers with knockdown punches in exhibition bouts It all seemed too good to betrue It was For all his gifts Hubble was also an inveterate liar This was more than a little odd for Hubble's life was filled from an early age with a level ofdistinction that was at times almost ludicrously golden At a single high school track meet in hewon the pole vault shot put discus hammer throw standing high jump and running high jump andwas on the winning mile relay team that is seven first places in one meet and came in third in thebroad jump In the same year he set a state record for the high jump in Illinois As a scholar he was equally proficient and had no trouble gaining admission to study physics andastronomy at the University of Chicago where coincidentally the head of the department was nowAlbert Michelson There he was selected to be one of the first Rhodes scholars at Oxford Threeyears of English life evidently turned his head for he returned to Wheaton in wearing anInverness cape smoking a pipe and talking with a peculiarly orotund accent not quite British butnot quite not that would remain with him for life Though he later claimed to have passed most ofthe second decade of the century practicing law in Kentucky in fact he worked as a high schoolteacher and basketball coach in New Albany Indiana before belatedly attaining his doctorate andpassing briefly through the Army He arrived in France one month before the Armistice and almostcertainly never heard a shot fired in anger In now aged thirty he moved to California and took up a position at the Mount WilsonObservatory near Los Angeles Swiftly and more than a little unexpectedly he became the mostoutstanding astronomer of the twentieth_century It is worth pausing for a moment to consider just how little was known of the cosmos at this time Astronomers today believe there are perhaps billion galaxies in the visible universe That's ahuge number much bigger_than merely saying it would lead you to suppose If galaxies were frozenpeas it would be enough to fill a large auditorium the old Boston Garden say or the Royal AlbertHall An astrophysicist named Bruce Gregory has actually computed this In when Hubblefirst put his head to the eyepiece the number of these galaxies that were known to us was exactly one the Milky_Way Everything else was thought to be either part of the Milky_Way itself or one of manydistant peripheral puffs of gas Hubble quickly demonstrated how wrong that belief was Over the next decade Hubble tackled two of the most fundamental questions of the universe howold is it and how big To answer both it is necessary to know two things how far away certaingalaxies are and how fast they are flying away from us what is known as their recessional velocity The red shift gives the speed at which galaxies are retiring but doesn't tell us how far away they areto begin with For that you need what are known as standard candles stars whose brightness canbe reliably calculated and used as benchmarks to measure the brightness and hence relative distance of other stars Hubble's luck was to come along soon_after an ingenious woman named Henrietta Swan Leavitthad figured out a way to do so Leavitt worked at the Harvard College Observatory as a computer asthey were known Computers spent their lives studying photographic plates of stars and makingcomputations hence the name It was little more than drudgery by another name but it was as closeas women could get to real astronomy at Harvard or indeed pretty much anywhere in those days The system however unfair did have certain unexpected benefits it meant that half the finest mindsavailable were directed to work that would otherwise have attracted little reflective attention and itensured that women ended_up with an appreciation of the fine structure of the cosmos that ofteneluded their male counterparts One Harvard computer Annie Jump Cannon used her repetitive acquaintance with the stars todevise a system of stellar classifications so practical that it is still in use today Leavitt's contributionwas even more profound She noticed that a type of star known as a Cepheid variable after theconstellation Cepheus where it first was identified pulsated with a regular rhythm a kind of stellarheartbeat Cepheids are quite rare but at_least one of them is well known to most of us Polaris thePole Star is a Cepheid We now know that Cepheids throb as they do because they are elderly stars that have moved pasttheir main sequence phase in the parlance of astronomers and become red giants The chemistry ofred giants is a little weighty for our purposes here it requires an appreciation for the properties ofsingly ionized helium atoms among quite a lot else but put simply it means that they burn theirremaining fuel in a way that produces a very rhythmic very reliable brightening and dimming Leavitt's genius was to realize that by comparing the relative magnitudes of Cepheids at differentpoints in the sky you could work out where they were in relation to each other They could be used as standard candles a term she coined and still in universal use The method provided only relativedistances not absolute distances but even so it was the first time that anyone had come up with ausable way to measure the large scale universe Just to put these insights into perspective it is perhaps worth noting that at the time Leavitt andCannon were inferring fundamental properties of the cosmos from dim smudges on photographicplates the Harvard astronomer William_H Pickering who could of course peer into a first classtelescope as often as he wanted was developing his seminal theory that dark patches on the Moonwere caused by swarms of seasonally migrating insects Combining Leavitt's cosmic yardstick with Vesto Slipher's handy red shifts Edwin Hubble nowbegan to measure selected points in space with a fresh eye In he showed that a puff of distantgossamer in the Andromeda constellation known as M wasn't a gas cloud at all but a blaze of stars a galaxy in its own right a hundred thousand light years across and at_least nine hundred thousandlight years away The universe was vaster vastly vaster than anyone had ever supposed In he produced a landmark paper Cepheids in Spiral Nebulae nebulae from the Latin for clouds was his word for galaxies showing that the universe consisted not just of the Milky_Way but of lotsof independent galaxies island universes many of them bigger_than the Milky_Way and muchmore distant This finding alone would have ensured Hubble's reputation but he now turned to the question ofworking out just how much vaster the universe was and made an even more striking discovery Hubble began to measure the spectra of distant galaxies the business that Slipher had begun inArizona Using Mount Wilson's new hundred inch Hooker telescope and some clever inferences heworked out that all the galaxies in the sky except for our_own local cluster are moving away fromus Moreover their speed and distance were neatly proportional the further away the galaxy thefaster it was moving This was truly startling The universe was expanding swiftly and evenly in all directions It didn'ttake a huge amount of imagination to read backwards from this and realize that it must therefore havestarted from some central point Far from being the stable fixed eternal void that everyone hadalways assumed this was a universe that had a beginning It might therefore also have an end The wonder as Stephen Hawking has noted is that no one had hit on the idea of the expandinguniverse before A static universe as should have been obvious to Newton and every thinkingastronomer since would collapse in upon itself There was also the problem that if stars had beenburning indefinitely in a static universe they'd have made the whole intolerably hot certainly muchtoo hot for the likes of us An expanding universe resolved much of this at a stroke Hubble was a much better observer than a thinker and didn't immediately appreciate the fullimplications of what he had found Partly this was because he was woefully ignorant of Einstein'sGeneral Theory of Relativity This was quite remarkable because for one thing Einstein and histheory were world famous by now Moreover in Albert Michelson now in his twilight yearsbut still one of the world's most alert and esteemed scientists accepted a position at Mount Wilsonto measure the velocity of light with his trusty interferometer and must surely have at_least mentionedto him the applicability of Einstein's theory to his own findings At all events Hubble failed to make theoretical hay when the chance was there Instead it was leftto a Belgian priest scholar with a Ph D from MIT named Georges Lema tre to bring together thetwo strands in his own fireworks theory which suggested that the universe began as a geometricalpoint a primeval atom which burst into glory and had been moving apart ever_since It was an ideathat very neatly anticipated the modern conception of the Big_Bang but was so far ahead of its timethat Lema tre seldom gets more than the sentence or two that we have given him here The worldwould need additional decades and the inadvertent discovery of cosmic background radiation byPenzias and Wilson at their hissing antenna in New_Jersey before the Big_Bang would begin to movefrom interesting idea to established theory Neither Hubble nor Einstein would be much of a part of that big story Though no one would haveguessed it at the time both men had done about as much as they were ever going to do In Hubble produced a popular_book called The Realm of the Nebulae which explained inflattering style his own considerable achievements Here at last he showed that he had acquaintedhimself with Einstein's theory up to a point anyway he gave it four pages out of about two hundred Hubble died of a heart attack in One last small oddity awaited him For reasons cloaked inmystery his wife declined to have a funeral and never revealed what she did with his body Half acentury later the whereabouts of the century's greatest astronomer remain unknown For a memorialyou must look to the sky and the Hubble Space Telescope launched in and named in his honor THE MIGHTY ATOMWHILE EINSTEIN AND Hubble were productively unraveling the large scale structure of thecosmos others were struggling to understand something closer to hand but in its way just as remote the tiny and ever mysterious atom The great Caltech physicist Richard_Feynman once observed that if you had to reduce scientifichistory to one important statement it would be All things are made of atoms They are everywhereand they constitute every thing Look around you It is all atoms Not just the solid things like wallsand tables and sofas but the air in between And they are there in numbers that you really cannotconceive The basic working arrangement of atoms is the molecule from the Latin for little mass Amolecule is simply two or more atoms working together in a more or less stable arrangement addtwo atoms of hydrogen to one of oxygen and you have a molecule of water Chemists tend to think interms of molecules rather than elements in much the way that writers tend to think in terms of wordsand not letters so it is molecules they count and these are numerous to say the least At sea level at atemperature of degrees_Fahrenheit one cubic centimeter of air that is a space about the size of asugar cube will contain billion billion molecules And they are in every single cubic centimeteryou see around you Think how many cubic centimeters there are in the world outside your window how many sugar cubes it would take to fill that view Then think how many it would take to build auniverse Atoms in short are very abundant They are also fantastically durable Because they are so long lived atoms really get around Everyatom you possess has almost_certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions oforganisms on its way to becoming you We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorouslyrecycled at death that a significant number of our atoms up to a billion for each of us it has beensuggested probably once belonged to Shakespeare A billion more each came from Buddha andGenghis Khan and Beethoven and any other historical figure you care to name The personages haveto be historical apparently as it takes the atoms some decades to become thoroughly redistributed however much you may wish it you are not yet one with Elvis Presley So we are all reincarnations though short lived ones When we die our atoms will disassembleand move off to find new uses elsewhere as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew Atoms however go on practically forever Nobody actually knows how long an atom can survive but according to Martin Rees it is probably about years a number so big that even I_am happyto express it in notation Above_all atoms are tiny very tiny indeed Half a million of them lined up shoulder to shouldercould hide behind a human hair On such a scale an individual atom is essentially impossible toimagine but we can of course try Start with a millimeter which is a line this long Now imagine that line divided into a thousandequal widths Each of those widths is a micron This is the scale of microorganisms A typicalparamecium for_instance is about two microns wide millimeters which is really very small If you wanted to see with your naked eye a paramecium swimming in a drop of water you wouldhave to enlarge the drop until it was some forty feet across However if you wanted to see the atomsin the same drop you would have to make the drop fifteen miles across Atoms in other words exist on a scale of minuteness of another order altogether To get down tothe scale of atoms you would need to take each one of those micron slices and shave it into tenthousand finer widths That's the scale of an atom one ten millionth of a millimeter It is a degree ofslenderness way beyond the capacity of our imaginations but you can get some idea of theproportions if you bear in mind that one atom is to the width of a millimeter line as the thickness of asheet of paper is to the height of the Empire State Building It is of course the abundance and extreme durability of atoms that makes them so useful and thetininess that makes them so hard to detect and understand The realization that atoms are these threethings small numerous practically indestructible and that all things are made from them firstoccurred not to Antoine Laurent Lavoisier as you might expect or even to Henry Cavendish orHumphry Davy but rather to a spare and lightly educated English Quaker named John Dalton whomwe first encountered in the chapter on chemistry Dalton was born in on the edge of the Lake District near Cockermouth to a family of poor butdevout Quaker weavers Four years later the poet William Wordsworth would also join the world atCockermouth He was an exceptionally bright student so very bright indeed that at the improbablyyouthful age of twelve he was put in charge of the local Quaker school This perhaps says as muchabout the school as about Dalton's precocity but perhaps not we know from his diaries that at aboutthis time he was reading Newton's Principia in the original Latin and other works of a similarlychallenging nature At fifteen still schoolmastering he took a job in the nearby town of Kendal and adecade after that he moved to Manchester scarcely stirring from there for the remaining fifty years ofhis life In Manchester he became something of an intellectual whirlwind producing books andpapers on subjects ranging from meteorology to grammar Color blindness a condition from which hesuffered was for a long time called Daltonism because of his studies But it was a plump book calledA New System of Chemical Philosophy published in that established his reputation There in a short chapter of just five pages out of the book's more than nine hundred people oflearning first encountered atoms in something approaching their modern conception Dalton's simpleinsight was that at the root of all matter are exceedingly tiny irreducible particles We might as wellattempt to introduce a new planet into the solar_system or annihilate one already in existence as tocreate or destroy a particle of hydrogen he wrote Neither the idea of atoms nor the term itself was exactly new Both had been developed by theancient Greeks Dalton's contribution was to consider the relative sizes and characters of these atomsand how they fit together He knew for_instance that hydrogen was the lightest element so he gave itan atomic weight of one He believed also that water consisted of seven parts of oxygen to one ofhydrogen and so he gave oxygen an atomic weight of seven By such means was he able to arrive atthe relative weights of the known elements He wasn't always terribly accurate oxygen's atomicweight is actually sixteen not seven but the principle was sound and formed the basis for all ofmodern chemistry and much of the rest of modern science The work made Dalton famous albeit in a low key English Quaker sort of way In theFrench chemist P J Pelletier traveled to Manchester to meet the atomic hero Pelletier expected tofind him attached to some grand institution so he was astounded to discover him teaching elementaryarithmetic to boys in a small school on a back street According to the scientific historian E J Holmyard a confused Pelletier upon beholding the great man stammered Est ce que j'ai l'honneur de m'addresser Monsieur Dalton for he could hardly believe hiseyes that this was the chemist of European fame teaching a boy his first four rules Yes saidthe matter of fact Quaker Wilt thou sit down whilst I put this lad right about his arithmetic Although Dalton tried to avoid all honors he was elected to the Royal_Society against his wishes showered with medals and given a handsome government pension When he died in fortythousand people viewed the coffin and the funeral cortege stretched for two miles His entry in theDictionary of National_Biography is one of the longest rivaled in length only by those of Darwinand Lyell among nineteenth_century men of science For a century after Dalton made his proposal it remained entirely hypothetical and a few eminentscientists notably the Viennese physicist Ernst Mach for whom is named the speed of sound doubted the existence of atoms at all Atoms cannot be perceived by the senses they are things ofthought he wrote The existence of atoms was so doubtfully held in the German speaking world inparticular that it was said to have played a part in the suicide of the great theoretical physicist andatomic enthusiast Ludwig Boltzmann in It was Einstein who provided the first incontrovertible evidence of atoms' existence with his paperon Brownian motion in but this attracted little attention and in any case Einstein was soon tobecome consumed with his work on general relativity So the first real hero of the atomic age if notthe first personage on the scene was Ernest Rutherford Rutherford was born in in the back blocks of New_Zealand to parents who had emigratedfrom Scotland to raise a little flax and a lot of children to paraphrase Steven Weinberg Growing upin a remote part of a remote country he was about as far from the mainstream of science as it waspossible to be but in he won a scholarship that took him to the Cavendish Laboratory atCambridge University which was about to become the hottest place in the world to do physics Physicists are notoriously scornful of scientists from other fields When the wife of the great Austrianphysicist Wolfgang Pauli left him for a chemist he was staggered with disbelief Had she taken abullfighter I would have understood he remarked in wonder to a friend But a chemist It was a feeling Rutherford would have understood All science is either physics or stampcollecting he once said in a line that has been used many times since There is a certain engagingirony therefore that when he won the Nobel_Prize in it was in chemistry not physics Rutherford was a lucky man lucky to be a genius but even luckier to live at a time when physicsand chemistry were so exciting and so compatible his own sentiments notwithstanding Never againwould they quite so comfortably overlap For all his success Rutherford was not an especially brilliant man and was actually pretty terribleat mathematics Often during lectures he would get so lost in his own equations that he would give uphalfway through and tell the students to work it out for themselves According to his longtimecolleague James Chadwick discoverer of the neutron he wasn't even particularly clever atexperimentation He was simply tenacious and open minded For brilliance he substituted shrewdnessand a kind of daring His mind in the words of one biographer was always operating out towardsthe frontiers as far as he could see and that was a great_deal further than most other men Confronted with an intractable problem he was prepared to work at it harder and longer than mostpeople and to be more receptive to unorthodox explanations His greatest breakthrough came becausehe was prepared to spend immensely tedious hours sitting at a screen counting alpha particlescintillations as they were known the sort of work that would normally have been farmed out Hewas one of the first to see possibly the very first that the power inherent in the atom could ifharnessed make bombs powerful enough to make this old world vanish in smoke Physically he was big and booming with a voice that made the timid shrink Once when told thatRutherford was about to make a radio broadcast across the Atlantic a colleague drily asked Whyuse radio He also had a huge amount of good natured confidence When someone remarked to himthat he seemed always to be at the crest of a wave he responded Well after all I made the wave didn't I C P Snow recalled how once in a Cambridge tailor's he overheard Rutherford remark Every_day I grow in girth And in mentality But both girth and fame were far ahead of him in when he fetched up at the Cavendish Itwas a singularly eventful period in science In the year of his arrival in Cambridge WilhelmRoentgen discovered X rays at the University of W rzburg in Germany and the next year HenriBecquerel discovered radioactivity And the Cavendish itself was about to embark on a long periodof greatness In J J Thomson and colleagues would discover the electron there in C T R Wilson would produce the first particle detector there as we shall_see and in JamesChadwick would discover the neutron there Further still in the future James Watson and FrancisCrick would discover the structure of DNA at the Cavendish in In the beginning Rutherford worked on radio waves and with some distinction he managed totransmit a crisp signal more than a mile a very reasonable achievement for the time but gave it upwhen he was persuaded by a senior colleague that radio had little future On the whole however Rutherford didn't thrive at the Cavendish After three years there feeling he was going nowhere hetook a post at McGill University in Montreal and there he began his long and steady rise to greatness By the time he received his Nobel_Prize for investigations into the disintegration of the elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances according to the official citation he had moved on toManchester University and it was there in fact that he would do his most important work indetermining the structure and nature of the atom By the early twentieth_century it was known that atoms were made of parts Thomson's discoveryof the electron had established that but it wasn't known how many parts there were or how they fittogether or what shape they took Some physicists thought that atoms might be cube shaped becausecubes can be packed together so neatly without any wasted space The more general view however was that an atom was more like a currant bun or a plum pudding a dense solid object that carried apositive charge but that was studded with negatively charged electrons like the currants in a currantbun In Rutherford assisted by his student Hans Geiger who would later invent the radiationdetector that bears his name fired ionized helium atoms or alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil To Rutherford's astonishment some of the particles bounced back It was as if he said he had fired afifteen inch shell at a sheet of paper and it rebounded into his lap This was just not supposed tohappen After considerable reflection he realized there could be only one possible explanation theparticles that bounced back were striking something small and dense at the heart of the atom whilethe other particles sailed through unimpeded An atom Rutherford realized was mostly empty space with a very dense nucleus at the center This was a most gratifying discovery but it presented oneimmediate problem By all the laws of conventional physics atoms shouldn't therefore exist Let us pause for a moment and consider the structure of the atom as we know it now Every atom ismade from three kinds of elementary particles protons which have a positive electrical charge electrons which have a negative electrical charge and neutrons which have no charge Protons andneutrons are packed into the nucleus while electrons spin around outside The number of protons iswhat gives an atom its chemical identity An atom with one proton is an atom of hydrogen one withtwo protons is helium with three protons is lithium and so on up the scale Each time you add aproton you get a new element Because the number of protons in an atom is always balanced by anequal number of electrons you will sometimes see it written that it is the number of electrons thatdefines an element it comes to the same thing The way it was explained to me is that protons give anatom its identity electrons its personality Neutrons don't influence an atom's identity but they do add to its mass The number of neutrons isgenerally about the same as the number of protons but they can vary up and down slightly Add aneutron or two and you get an isotope The terms you hear in reference to dating techniques inarcheology refer to isotopes carbon for_instance which is an atom of carbon with six protonsand eight neutrons the fourteen being the sum of the two Neutrons and protons occupy the atom's nucleus The nucleus of an atom is tiny only one millionthof a billionth of the full volume of the atom but fantastically dense since it contains virtually all theatom's mass As Cropper has put it if an atom were expanded to the size of a cathedral the nucleuswould be only about the size of a fly but a fly many thousands of times heavier than the cathedral Itwas this spaciousness this resounding unexpected roominess that had Rutherford scratching hishead in It is still a fairly astounding notion to consider that atoms are mostly empty space and that thesolidity we experience all around us is an illusion When two objects come together in the real world billiard balls are most often used for illustration they don't actually strike each other Rather as Timothy Ferris explains the negatively charged fields of the two balls repel each other wereit not for their electrical charges they could like galaxies pass right through each other unscathed When you sit in a chair you are not actually sitting there but levitating above it at a height of oneangstrom a hundred millionth of a centimeter your electrons and its electrons implacably opposedto any closer intimacy The picture that nearly everybody has in mind of an atom is of an electron or two flying around anucleus like planets orbiting a sun This image was created in based on little more than cleverguesswork by a Japanese physicist named Hantaro Nagaoka It is completely wrong but durable justthe same As Isaac Asimov liked to note it inspired generations of science fiction writers to createstories of worlds within worlds in which atoms become tiny inhabited solar systems or our solarsystem turns_out to be merely a mote in some much larger scheme Even now CERN the EuropeanOrganization for Nuclear Research uses Nagaoka's image as a logo on its website In_fact asphysicists were soon to realize electrons are not like orbiting planets at all but more like the bladesof a spinning fan managing to fill every bit of space in their orbits simultaneously but with thecrucial difference that the blades of a fan only seem to be everywhere at once electrons are Needless to say very little of this was understood in or for many years afterward Rutherford'sfinding presented some large and immediate problems not least that no electron should be able toorbit a nucleus without crashing Conventional electrodynamic theory demanded that a flying electronshould very quickly run out of energy in only an instant or so and spiral into the nucleus withdisastrous consequences for both There was also the problem of how protons with their positivecharges could bundle together inside the nucleus without blowing themselves and the rest of the atomapart Clearly whatever was going on down there in the world of the very small was not governed bythe laws that applied in the macro world where our expectations reside As physicists began to delve into this subatomic realm they realized that it wasn't merely differentfrom anything we knew but different from anything ever imagined Because atomic behavior is sounlike ordinary experience Richard_Feynman once observed it is very difficult to get used to and itappears peculiar and mysterious to everyone both to the novice and to the experienced physicist When Feynman made that comment physicists had had half a century to adjust to the strangeness ofatomic behavior So think how it must have felt to Rutherford and his colleagues in the early swhen it was all brand new One of the people working with Rutherford was a mild and affable young Dane named Niels Bohr In while puzzling over the structure of the atom Bohr had an idea so exciting that he postponedhis honeymoon to write what became a landmark paper Because physicists couldn't see anything sosmall as an atom they had to try to work out its structure from how it behaved when they did things toit as Rutherford had done by firing alpha particles at foil Sometimes not surprisingly the results ofthese experiments were puzzling One puzzle that had been around for a long time had to do withspectrum readings of the wavelengths of hydrogen These produced patterns showing that hydrogenatoms emitted energy at certain wavelengths but not others It was rather as if someone undersurveillance kept turning up at particular locations but was never observed traveling between them No one could understand why this should be It was while puzzling over this problem that Bohr was struck by a solution and dashed off hisfamous paper Called On the Constitutions of Atoms and Molecules the paper explained howelectrons could keep from falling into the nucleus by suggesting that they could occupy only certainwell defined orbits According to the new theory an electron moving between orbits woulddisappear from one and reappear instantaneously in another without visiting the space between Thisidea the famous quantum leap is of course utterly strange but it was too good not to be true Itnot only kept electrons from spiraling catastrophically into the nucleus it also explained hydrogen'sbewildering wavelengths The electrons only appeared in certain orbits because they only existed incertain orbits It was a dazzling insight and it won Bohr the Nobel_Prize in physics the yearafter Einstein received his Meanwhile the tireless Rutherford now back at Cambridge as J J Thomson's successor as head ofthe Cavendish Laboratory came up with a model that explained why the nuclei didn't blow up Hesaw that they must be offset by some type of neutralizing particles which he called neutrons The ideawas simple and appealing but not easy to prove Rutherford's associate James Chadwick devotedeleven intensive years to hunting for neutrons before finally succeeding in He too wasawarded with a Nobel_Prize in physics in As Boorse and his colleagues point out in theirhistory of the subject the delay in discovery was probably a very good thing as mastery of the neutronwas essential to the development of the atomic bomb Because neutrons have no charge they aren'trepelled by the electrical fields at the heart of an atom and thus could be fired like tiny torpedoes intoan atomic nucleus setting off the destructive process known as fission Had the neutron been isolatedin the s they note it is very likely the atomic bomb would have been developed first in Europe undoubtedly by the Germans As it was the Europeans had their hands full trying to understand the strange behavior of theelectron The principal problem they faced was that the electron sometimes behaved like a particleand sometimes like a wave This impossible duality drove physicists nearly mad For the next decadeall across Europe they furiously thought and scribbled and offered competing hypotheses In France Prince Louis Victor de Broglie the scion of a ducal family found that certain anomalies in thebehavior of electrons disappeared when one regarded them as waves The observation excited theattention of the Austrian Erwin Schr dinger who made some deft refinements and devised a handysystem called wave mechanics At almost the same time the German physicist Werner Heisenbergcame up with a competing theory called matrix mechanics This was so mathematically complex thathardly anyone really understood it including Heisenberg himself I do not even know what a matrixis Heisenberg despaired to a friend at one point but it did seem to solve certain problems thatSchr dinger's waves failed to explain The upshot is that physics had two theories based on conflicting premises that produced the sameresults It was an impossible situation Finally in Heisenberg came up with a celebrated compromise producing a new disciplinethat came to be known as quantum mechanics At the heart of it was Heisenberg's UncertaintyPrinciple which states that the electron is a particle but a particle that can be described in terms ofwaves The uncertainty around which the theory is built is that we can know the path an electron takesas it moves through a space or we can know where it is at a given instant but we cannot knowboth Any attempt to measure one will unavoidably disturb the other This isn't a matter of simplyneeding more precise instruments it is an immutable property of the universe What this means in practice is that you can never predict where an electron will be at any givenmoment You can only list its probability of being there In a sense as Dennis Overbye has put it anelectron doesn't exist until it is observed Or put slightly differently until it is observed an electronmust be regarded as being at once everywhere and nowhere If this seems confusing you may take some comfort in knowing that it was confusing to physicists too Overbye notes Bohr once commented that a person who wasn't outraged on first hearing aboutquantum theory didn't understand what had been said Heisenberg when asked how one couldenvision an atom replied Don't try So the atom turned_out to be quite unlike the image that most people had created The electrondoesn't fly around the nucleus like a planet around its sun but instead takes on the more amorphousaspect of a cloud The shell of an atom isn't some hard shiny casing as illustrations sometimesencourage us to suppose but simply the outermost of these fuzzy electron clouds The cloud itself isessentially just a zone of statistical probability marking the area beyond which the electron only veryseldom strays Thus an atom if you could see it would look more like a very fuzzy tennis ball than ahard edged metallic sphere but not much like either or indeed like anything you've ever seen weare after all dealing here with a world very different from the one we see around us It seemed as if there was no end of strangeness For the first time as James Trefil has put it scientists had encountered an area of the universe that our brains just aren't wired to understand Oras Feynman expressed it things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale Asphysicists delved deeper they realized they had found a world where not only could electrons jumpfrom one orbit to another without traveling across any intervening space but matter could pop intoexistence from nothing at all provided in the words of Alan Lightman of MIT it disappearsagain with sufficient haste Perhaps the most arresting of quantum improbabilities is the idea arising from Wolfgang Pauli'sExclusion Principle of that the subatomic particles in certain pairs even when separated by themost considerable distances can each instantly know what the other is doing Particles have aquality known as spin and according to quantum_theory the moment you determine the spin of oneparticle its sister particle no matter how distant away will immediately begin spinning in theopposite direction and at the same rate It is as if in the words of the science writer Lawrence Joseph you had two identical pool balls one in Ohio and the other in Fiji and the instant you sent one spinning the other would immediatelyspin in a contrary direction at precisely the same speed Remarkably the phenomenon was proved in when physicists at the University of Geneva sent photons seven miles in opposite directions anddemonstrated that interfering with one provoked an instantaneous response in the other Things reached such a pitch that at one conference Bohr remarked of a new theory that the questionwas not whether it was crazy but whether it was crazy enough To illustrate the nonintuitive nature ofthe quantum world Schr dinger offered a famous thought experiment in which a hypothetical cat wasplaced in a box with one atom of a radioactive substance attached to a vial of hydrocyanic acid If theparticle degraded within an_hour it would trigger a mechanism that would break the vial and poisonthe cat If not the cat would live But we could not know which was the case so there was no choice scientifically but to regard the cat as percent alive and percent dead at the same time Thismeans as Stephen Hawking has observed with a touch of understandable excitement that one cannot predict future events exactly if one cannot even measure the present state of the universe precisely Because of its oddities many physicists disliked quantum_theory or at_least certain aspects of it and none more so than Einstein This was more than a little ironic since it was he in his annusmirabilis of who had so persuasively explained how photons of light could sometimes behavelike particles and sometimes like waves the notion at the very heart of the new physics Quantumtheory is very worthy of regard he observed politely but he really didn't like it God doesn't playdice he said Einstein couldn't bear the notion that God could create a universe in which some things wereforever unknowable Moreover the idea of action at a distance that one particle couldinstantaneously influence another trillions of miles_away was a stark violation of the special theoryof relativity This expressly decreed that nothing could outrace the speed of light and yet here werephysicists insisting that somehow at the subatomic level information could No one incidentally has ever explained how the particles achieve this feat Scientists have dealt with this problem according to the physicist Yakir Aharanov by not thinking about it Above_all there was the problem that quantum physics introduced a level of untidiness that hadn'tpreviously existed Suddenly you needed two sets of laws to explain the behavior of the universe quantum_theory for the world of the very small and relativity for the larger universe beyond Thegravity of relativity theory was brilliant at explaining why planets orbited suns or why galaxiestended to cluster but turned_out to have no influence at all at the particle level To explain what keptatoms together other forces were needed and in the s two were discovered the strong nuclearforce and weak nuclear force The strong force binds atoms together it's what allows protons to beddown together in the nucleus The weak force engages in more miscellaneous tasks mostly to do withcontrolling the rates of certain sorts of radioactive decay The weak nuclear force despite its name is ten billion billion billion times stronger than gravity and the strong nuclear force is more powerful still vastly so in fact but their influence extends toonly the tiniest distances The grip of the strong force reaches out only to about of thediameter of an atom That's_why the nuclei of atoms are so compacted and dense and why elementswith big crowded nuclei tend to be so unstable the strong force just can't hold on to all the protons The upshot of all this is that physics ended_up with two bodies of laws one for the world of thevery small one for the universe at large leading quite separate lives Einstein disliked that too Hedevoted the rest of his life to searching for a way to tie up these loose ends by finding a grand unifiedtheory and always failed From time to time he thought he had it but it always unraveled on him inthe end As time passed he became increasingly marginalized and even a little pitied Almost withoutexception wrote Snow his colleagues thought and still think that he wasted the second half of hislife Elsewhere however real progress was being made By the mid_s scientists had reached apoint where they understood the atom at an extremely profound level as they all too effectivelydemonstrated in August by exploding a pair of atomic bombs over Japan By this point physicists could be excused for thinking that they had just about conquered the atom In_fact everything in particle physics was about to get a whole lot more complicated But before wetake up that slightly exhausting story we must bring another straw of our history up to date byconsidering an important and salutary tale of avarice deceit bad science several needless deaths and the final determination of the age of the Earth GETTING THE LEAD OUTIN THE LATE s a graduate_student at the University of Chicago named Clair Patterson whowas first name notwithstanding an Iowa farm boy by origin was using a new method of lead isotopemeasurement to try to get a definitive age for the Earth at last Unfortunately all his samples came upcontaminated usually wildly so Most contained something like two hundred times the levels of leadthat would normally be expected to occur Many years would pass before Patterson realized that thereason for this lay with a regrettable Ohio inventor named Thomas Midgley Jr Midgley was an engineer by training and the world would no doubt have been a safer place if hehad stayed so Instead he developed an interest in the industrial applications of chemistry In while working for the General Motors Research Corporation in Dayton Ohio he investigated acompound called tetraethyl_lead also known confusingly as lead tetraethyl and discovered that itsignificantly reduced the juddering condition known as engine knock Even though lead was widely known to be dangerous by the early years of the twentieth_century itcould be found in all manner of consumer products Food came in cans sealed with lead solder Water was often stored in lead lined tanks It was sprayed onto fruit as a pesticide in the form of leadarsenate It even came as part of the packaging of toothpaste tubes Hardly a product existed thatdidn't bring a little lead into consumers' lives However nothing gave it a greater and more lastingintimacy than its addition to gasoline Lead is a neurotoxin Get too much of it and you can irreparably damage the brain and centralnervous system Among the many symptoms associated_with overexposure are blindness insomnia kidney failure hearing loss cancer palsies and convulsions In its most acute form it producesabrupt and terrifying hallucinations disturbing to victims and onlookers alike which generally thengive way to coma and death You really don't want to get too much lead into your system On the other hand lead was easy to extract and work and almost embarrassingly profitable toproduce industrially and tetraethyl_lead did indubitably stop engines from knocking So in three of America's largest corporations General Motors Du Pont and Standard Oil of New_Jersey formed a joint enterprise called the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation later shortened to simply EthylCorporation with a view to making as much tetraethyl_lead as the world was willing to buy and thatproved to be a very great_deal They called their additive ethyl because it sounded friendlier andless toxic than lead and introduced it for public consumption in more ways than most peoplerealized on February Almost at once production workers began to exhibit the staggered gait and confused faculties thatmark the recently poisoned Also almost at once the Ethyl Corporation embarked on a policy of calmbut unyielding denial that would serve it well for decades As Sharon Bertsch McGrayne notes in herabsorbing history of industrial chemistry Prometheans in the Lab when employees at one plantdeveloped irreversible delusions a spokesman blandly informed reporters These men probablywent insane because they worked too hard Altogether at_least fifteen workers died in the early daysof production of leaded gasoline and untold numbers of others became ill often violently so theexact numbers are unknown because the company nearly always managed to hush up news ofembarrassing leakages spills and poisonings At times however suppressing the news becameimpossible most notably in when in a matter of days five production workers died and thirtyfive more were turned into permanent staggering wrecks at a single ill ventilated facility As rumors circulated about the dangers of the new product ethyl's ebullient inventor ThomasMidgley decided to hold a demonstration for reporters to allay their concerns As he chatted awayabout the company's commitment to safety he poured tetraethyl_lead over his hands then held abeaker of it to his nose for sixty seconds claiming all the while that he could repeat the proceduredaily without harm In_fact Midgley knew only too well the perils of lead poisoning he had himselfbeen made seriously ill from overexposure a few months earlier and now except when reassuringjournalists never went near the stuff if he could help it Buoyed by the success of leaded gasoline Midgley now turned to another technological problem ofthe age Refrigerators in the s were often appallingly risky because they used dangerous gasesthat sometimes leaked One leak from a refrigerator at a hospital in Cleveland Ohio in killedmore than a hundred people Midgley set out to create a gas that was stable nonflammable noncorrosive and safe to breathe With an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny heinvented chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs Seldom has an industrial product been more swiftly or unfortunately embraced CFCs went intoproduction in the early_s and found a thousand applications in everything from car airconditioners to deodorant sprays before it was noticed half a century later that they were devouringthe ozone in the stratosphere As you will be aware this was not a good thing Ozone is a form of oxygen in which each molecule bears three atoms of oxygen instead of two It isa bit of a chemical oddity in that at ground level it is a pollutant while way up in the stratosphere it isbeneficial since it soaks up dangerous ultraviolet radiation Beneficial ozone is not terribly abundant however If it were distributed evenly throughout the stratosphere it would form a layer just oneeighth of an inch or so thick That is why it is so easily disturbed and why such disturbances don'ttake long to become critical Chlorofluorocarbons are also not very abundant they constitute only about one part per billion ofthe atmosphere as a whole but they are extravagantly destructive One pound of CFCs can captureand annihilate seventy thousand pounds of atmospheric ozone CFCs also hang around for a long time about a century on average wreaking havoc all the while They are also great heat sponges Asingle CFC molecule is about ten_thousand times more efficient at exacerbating greenhouse effectsthan a molecule of carbon_dioxide and carbon_dioxide is of course no slouch itself as a greenhousegas In short chlorofluorocarbons may ultimately prove to be just about the worst invention of thetwentieth century Midgley never knew this because he died long before anyone realized how destructive CFCs were His death was itself memorably unusual After becoming crippled with polio Midgley invented acontraption involving a series of motorized pulleys that automatically raised or turned him in bed In he became entangled in the cords as the machine went into action and was strangled If you were interested in finding out the ages of things the University of Chicago in the s was theplace to be Willard Libby was in the process of inventing radiocarbon dating allowing scientists toget an accurate reading of the age of bones and other organic remains something they had never beenable to do before Up to this time the oldest reliable dates went back no further than the First Dynastyin Egypt from about B C No one could confidently say for_instance when the last ice_sheets hadretreated or at what time in the past the Cro Magnon people had decorated the caves of Lascaux inFrance Libby's idea was so useful that he would be awarded a Nobel_Prize for it in It was based onthe realization that all living_things have within them an isotope of carbon called carbon whichbegins to decay at a measurable rate the instant they die Carbon has a half life that is the time ittakes for half of any sample to disappear of about years so by working out how much agiven sample of carbon had decayed Libby could get a good fix on the age of an object though onlyup to a point After eight half lives only of the original radioactive carbon remains which istoo little to make a reliable measurement so radiocarbon dating works only for objects up to fortythousand or so years_old Curiously just as the technique was becoming widespread certain flaws within it becameapparent To begin with it was discovered that one of the basic components of Libby's formula known as the decay constant was off by about percent By this time however thousands ofmeasurements had been taken throughout the world Rather than restate every one scientists decidedto keep the inaccurate constant Thus Tim_Flannery notes every raw radiocarbon date you readtoday is given as too young by around percent The problems didn't quite stop there It was alsoquickly discovered that carbon samples can be easily contaminated with carbon from othersources a tiny scrap of vegetable matter for_instance that has been collected with the sample andnot noticed For younger samples those under twenty thousand years or so slight contaminationdoes not always matter so much but for older samples it can be a serious problem because so fewremaining atoms are being counted In the first instance to borrow from Flannery it is likemiscounting by a dollar when counting to a thousand in the second it is more like miscounting by adollar when you have only two dollars to count Libby's method was also based on the assumption that the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and the rate at which it has been absorbed by living_things has been consistent throughout history Infact it hasn't been We now know that the volume of atmospheric carbon varies depending on howwell or not Earth's magnetism is deflecting cosmic_rays and that that can vary significantly over time This means that some carbon dates are more dubious than others This is particularly so with datesjust around the time that people first came to the Americas which is one of the reasons the matter isso perennially in dispute Finally and perhaps a little unexpectedly readings can be thrown out by seemingly unrelatedexternal factors such as the diets of those whose bones are being tested One recent case involvedthe long running debate over whether syphilis originated in the New World or the Old Archeologistsin Hull in the north of England found that monks in a monastery graveyard had suffered fromsyphilis but the initial conclusion that the monks had done so before Columbus's voyage was cast intodoubt by the realization that they had eaten a lot of fish which could make their bones appear to beolder than in fact they were The monks may well have had syphilis but how it got to them and when remain tantalizingly unresolved Because of the accumulated shortcomings of carbon scientists devised other methods of datingancient materials among them thermoluminesence which measures electrons trapped in clays andelectron spin resonance which involves bombarding a sample with electromagnetic waves andmeasuring the vibrations of the electrons But even the best of these could not date anything older thanabout years and they couldn't date inorganic materials like rocks at all which is of coursewhat you need if you wish to determine the age of your planet The problems of dating rocks were such that at one point almost everyone in the world had givenup on them Had it not been for a determined English professor named Arthur Holmes the quest mightwell have fallen into abeyance altogether Holmes was heroic as much for the obstacles he overcame as for the results he achieved By the s when Holmes was in the prime of his career geology had slipped out of fashion physics wasthe new excitement of the age and had become severely underfunded particularly in Britain itsspiritual birthplace At Durham University Holmes was for many years the entire geologydepartment Often he had to borrow or patch together equipment in order to pursue his radiometricdating of rocks At one point his calculations were effectively held up for a year while he waited forthe university to provide him with a simple adding machine Occasionally he had to drop out ofacademic life altogether to earn enough to support his family for a time he ran a curio shop inNewcastle upon Tyne and sometimes he could not even afford the annual membership fee for theGeological Society The technique Holmes used in his work was theoretically straightforward and arose directly fromthe process first observed by Ernest Rutherford in in which some atoms decay from oneelement into another at a rate predictable enough that you can use them as clocks If you know howlong it takes for potassium to become argon and you measure the amounts of each in a sample you can work out how old a material is Holmes's contribution was to measure the decay rate ofuranium into lead to calculate the age of rocks and thus he hoped of the Earth But there were many technical difficulties to overcome Holmes also needed or at_least wouldvery much have appreciated sophisticated gadgetry of a sort that could make very finemeasurements from tiny samples and as we have seen it was all he could do to get a simple addingmachine So it was quite an achievement when in he was able to announce with someconfidence that the Earth was at_least three billion years_old and possibly rather more Unfortunately he now met yet another formidable impediment to acceptance the conservativeness of his fellowscientists Although happy to praise his methodology many maintained that he had found not the ageof the Earth but merely the age of the materials from which the Earth had been formed It was just at this time that Harrison Brown of the University of Chicago developed a new methodfor counting lead isotopes in igneous rocks which is to say those that were created through heating as opposed to the laying down of sediments Realizing that the work would be exceedingly tedious he assigned it to young Clair Patterson as his dissertation project Famously he promised Pattersonthat determining the age of the Earth with his new method would be duck soup In_fact it would takeyears Patterson began work on the project in Compared with Thomas Midgley's colorfulcontributions to the march of progress Patterson's discovery of the age of the Earth feels more than atouch anticlimactic For seven years first at the University of Chicago and then at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology where he moved in he worked in a sterile lab making very precisemeasurements of the lead uranium ratios in carefully selected samples of old rock The problem with measuring the age of the Earth was that you needed rocks that were extremelyancient containing lead and uranium bearing crystals that were about as old as the planet itself anything much younger would obviously give you misleadingly youthful dates but really ancientrocks are only rarely found on Earth In the late_s no one altogether understood why this shouldbe Indeed and rather extraordinarily we would be well into the space age before anyone couldplausibly account for where all the Earth's old rocks went The answer was plate_tectonics whichwe shall of course get to Patterson meantime was left to try to make sense of things with verylimited materials Eventually and ingeniously it occurred to him that he could circumvent the rockshortage by using rocks from beyond Earth He turned to meteorites The assumption he made rather a large one but correct as it turned_out was that manymeteorites are essentially leftover building materials from the early days of the solar_system and thushave managed to preserve a more or less pristine interior chemistry Measure the age of thesewandering rocks and you would have the age also near enough of the Earth As always however nothing was quite as straightforward as such a breezy description makes itsound Meteorites are not abundant and meteoritic samples not especially easy to get hold of Moreover Brown's measurement technique proved finicky in the extreme and needed muchrefinement Above_all there was the problem that Patterson's samples were continuously andunaccountably contaminated with large doses of atmospheric lead whenever they were exposed to air It was this that eventually led him to create a sterile laboratory the world's first according to atleast one account It took Patterson seven years of patient work just to assemble suitable samples for final testing Inthe spring of he traveled to the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois where he was grantedtime on a late model mass spectrograph a machine capable of detecting and measuring the minutequantities of uranium and lead locked up in ancient crystals When at last he had his results Pattersonwas so excited that he drove straight to his boyhood home in Iowa and had his mother check him intoa hospital because he thought he was having a heart attack Soon_afterward at a meeting in Wisconsin Patterson announced a definitive age for the Earth of million_years plus or minus million_years a figure that stands unchanged years later as McGrayne admiringly notes After two hundred years of trying the Earth finally had an age His main work done Patterson now turned his attention to the nagging question of all that lead in theatmosphere He was astounded to find that what little was known about the effects of lead on humanswas almost invariably wrong or misleading and not surprisingly he discovered since for fortyyears every study of lead's effects had been funded exclusively by manufacturers of lead additives In one such study a doctor who had no specialized training in chemical pathology undertook a fiveyear program in which volunteers were asked to breathe in or swallow lead in elevated quantities Then their urine and feces were tested Unfortunately as the doctor appears not to have known leadis not excreted as a waste product Rather it accumulates in the bones and blood that's what makesit so dangerous and neither bone nor blood was tested In consequence lead was given a clean billof health Patterson quickly established that we had a lot of lead in the atmosphere still do in fact sincelead never goes away and that about percent of it appeared to come from automobile exhaustpipes but he couldn't prove it What he needed was a way to compare lead levels in the atmospherenow with the levels that existed before when tetraethyl_lead was introduced It occurred to himthat ice cores could provide the answer It was known that snowfall in places like Greenland accumulates into discrete annual layers because seasonal temperature differences produce slight changes in coloration from winter tosummer By counting back through these layers and measuring the amount of lead in each he couldwork out global lead concentrations at any time for hundreds or even thousands of years The notionbecame the foundation of ice core studies on which much modern climatological work is based What Patterson found was that before there was almost no lead in the atmosphere and thatsince that time its level had climbed steadily and dangerously He now made it his life's quest to getlead taken out of gasoline To that end he became a constant and often vocal critic of the leadindustry and its interests It would prove to be a hellish campaign Ethyl was a powerful global corporation with manyfriends in high places Among its directors have been Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell andGilbert Grosvenor of the National_Geographic Society Patterson suddenly found research fundingwithdrawn or difficult to acquire The American Petroleum Institute canceled a research contract withhim as did the United_States Public Health Service a supposedly neutral government institution As Patterson increasingly became a liability to his institution the school trustees were repeatedlypressed by lead industry officials to shut him up or let him go According to Jamie Lincoln Kitman writing in The Nation in Ethyl executives allegedly offered to endow a chair at Caltech ifPatterson was sent packing Absurdly he was excluded from a National Research Councilpanel appointed to investigate the dangers of atmospheric lead poisoning even though he was by nowunquestionably the leading expert on atmospheric lead To his great credit Patterson never wavered or buckled Eventually his efforts led to theintroduction of the Clean Air Act of and finally to the removal from sale of all leaded gasolinein the United_States in Almost immediately lead levels in the blood of Americans fell by percent But because lead is forever those of us alive_today have about times more lead in ourblood than people did a century ago The amount of lead in the atmosphere also continues to grow quite legally by about a hundred thousand metric_tons a year mostly from mining smelting andindustrial activities The United_States also banned lead in indoor paint forty four years after mostof Europe as McGrayne notes Remarkably considering its startling toxicity lead solder was notremoved from American food containers until As for the Ethyl Corporation it's still going strong though GM Standard Oil and Du Pont nolonger have stakes in the company They sold out to a company called Albemarle Paper in According to McGrayne as late as February Ethyl continued to contend that research hasfailed to show that leaded gasoline poses a threat to human health or the environment On itswebsite a history of the company makes no mention of lead or indeed of Thomas Midgley butsimply refers to the original product as containing a certain combination of chemicals Ethyl no_longer makes leaded gasoline although according to its company accounts tetraethyl_lead or TEL as it calls it still accounted for million in sales in out of overallsales of million up from million in but down from million in In itsreport the company stated its determination to maximize the cash generated by TEL as its usagecontinues to phase down around the world Ethyl markets TEL through an agreement with AssociatedOctel of England As for the other scourge left to us by Thomas Midgley chlorofluorocarbons they were banned in in the United_States but they are tenacious little devils and any that you loosed into theatmosphere before then in your deodorants or hair sprays for_instance will almost_certainly bearound and devouring ozone long after you have shuffled off Worse we are still introducing hugeamounts of CFCs into the atmosphere every year According to Wayne Biddle million pounds ofthe stuff worth billion still finds its way onto the market every year So who is making it Weare that is to say many of our large corporations are still making it at their plants overseas It willnot be banned in Third World countries until Clair Patterson died in He didn't win a Nobel_Prize for his work Geologists never do Nor more puzzlingly did he gain any fame or even much attention from half a century of consistent andincreasingly selfless achievement A good case could be made that he was the most influentialgeologist of the twentieth_century Yet who has ever heard of Clair Patterson Most geology textbooksdon't mention him Two recent popular books on the history of the dating of Earth actually manage tomisspell his name In early a reviewer of one of these books in the journal Nature made theadditional rather astounding error of thinking Patterson was a woman At all events thanks to the work of Clair Patterson by the Earth at last had an age everyonecould agree on The only problem now was it was older than the universe that contained it MUSTER MARK'S QUARKSIN A British scientist named C T R Wilson was studying cloud formations by trampingregularly to the summit of Ben Nevis a famously damp Scottish mountain when it occurred to himthat there must be an easier way to study clouds Back in the Cavendish Lab in Cambridge he built anartificial cloud chamber a simple device in which he could cool and moisten the air creating areasonable model of a cloud in laboratory conditions The device worked very well but had an additional unexpected benefit When he accelerated analpha particle through the chamber to seed his make believe clouds it left a visible trail like thecontrails of a passing airliner He had just invented the particle detector It provided convincingevidence that subatomic particles did indeed exist Eventually two other Cavendish scientists invented a more powerful proton beam device while inCalifornia Ernest Lawrence at Berkeley produced his famous and impressive cyclotron or atomsmasher as such devices were long excitingly known All of these contraptions worked and indeedstill work on more or less the same principle the idea being to accelerate a proton or other chargedparticle to an extremely high speed along a track sometimes circular sometimes linear then bang itinto another particle and see what flies off That's_why they were called atom smashers It wasn'tscience at its subtlest but it was generally effective As physicists built bigger and more ambitious machines they began to find or postulate particles orparticle families seemingly without number muons pions hyperons mesons K mesons Higgsbosons intermediate vector bosons baryons tachyons Even physicists began to grow a littleuncomfortable Young man Enrico Fermi replied when a student asked him the name of a particularparticle if I could remember the names of these particles I would have been a botanist Today accelerators have names that sound like something Flash Gordon would use in battle theSuper Proton Synchrotron the Large Electron Positron Collider the Large Hadron Collider theRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider Using huge_amounts of energy some operate only at night so thatpeople in neighboring towns don't have to witness their lights fading when the apparatus is fired up they can whip particles into such a state of liveliness that a single electron can do forty seventhousand laps around a four mile tunnel in a second Fears have been raised that in their enthusiasmscientists might inadvertently create a black hole or even something called strange quarks whichcould theoretically interact with other subatomic particles and propagate uncontrollably If you arereading this that hasn't happened Finding particles takes a certain amount of concentration They are not just tiny and swift but alsooften tantalizingly evanescent Particles can come into being and be gone again in as little as second Even the most sluggish of unstable particles hangaround for no more than second Some particles are almost ludicrously slippery Every second the Earth is visited by trilliontrillion tiny all but massless neutrinos mostly shot out by the nuclear broilings of the Sun andvirtually all of them pass right through the planet and everything that is on it including you and me asif it weren't there To trap just a few of them scientists need tanks holding up to million gallonsof heavy water that is water with a relative abundance of deuterium in it in underground chambers old mines usually where they can't be interfered with by other types of radiation Very occasionally a passing neutrino will bang into one of the atomic nuclei in the water andproduce a little puff of energy Scientists count the puffs and by such means take us very slightlycloser to understanding the fundamental properties of the universe In Japanese observersreported that neutrinos do have mass but not a great_deal about one ten millionth that of an electron What it really takes to find particles these days is money and lots of it There is a curious inverserelationship in modern physics between the tininess of the thing being sought and the scale offacilities required to do the searching CERN the European Organization for Nuclear Research islike a little city Straddling the border of France and Switzerland it employs three thousand peopleand occupies a site that is measured in square miles CERN boasts a string of magnets that weighmore than the Eiffel Tower and an underground tunnel over sixteen miles around Breaking up atoms as James Trefil has noted is easy you do it each time you switch on afluorescent light Breaking up atomic nuclei however requires quite a lot of money and a generoussupply of electricity Getting down to the level of quarks the particles that make up particles requires still more trillions of volts of electricity and the budget of a small Central American nation CERN's new Large Hadron Collider scheduled to begin operations in will achieve fourteentrillion volts of energy and cost something over billion to construct But these numbers are as nothing compared with what could have been achieved by and spentupon the vast and now unfortunately never to be Superconducting Supercollider which began beingconstructed near Waxahachie Texas in the s before experiencing a supercollision of its ownwith the United_States Congress The intention of the collider was to let scientists probe the ultimatenature of matter as it is always put by re creating as nearly as possible the conditions in theuniverse during its first ten_thousand billionths of a second The plan was to fling particles through atunnel fifty two miles long achieving a truly staggering ninety nine trillion volts of energy It was agrand scheme but would also have cost billion to build a figure that eventually rose to billion and hundreds of millions of dollars a year to run In perhaps the finest example in history of pouring money into a hole in the ground Congress spent billion on the project then canceled it in after fourteen miles of tunnel had been dug SoTexas now boasts the most expensive hole in the universe The site is I_am told by my friend JeffGuinn of the Fort Worth Star Telegram essentially a vast cleared field dotted along thecircumference by a series of disappointed small towns Since the supercollider debacle particle physicists have set their sights a little lower but evencomparatively modest projects can be quite breathtakingly costly when compared with well almostanything A proposed neutrino observatory at the old Homestake Mine in Lead South Dakota wouldcost million to build this in a mine that is already dug before you even look at the annualrunning costs There would also be million of general conversion costs A particleaccelerator at Fermilab in Illinois meanwhile cost million merely to refit Particle physics in short is a hugely expensive enterprise but it is a productive one Today theparticle count is well over with a further or so suspected but unfortunately in the words ofRichard Feynman it is very difficult to understand the relationships of all these particles and whatnature wants them for or what the connections are from one to another Inevitably each time wemanage to unlock a box we find that there is another locked box inside Some people think there areparticles called tachyons which can travel faster than the speed of light Others long to find gravitons the seat of gravity At what point we reach the irreducible bottom is not easy to say Carl Sagan inCosmos raised the possibility that if you traveled downward into an electron you might find that itcontained a universe of its own recalling all those science fiction stories of the fifties Within it organized into the local equivalent of galaxies and smaller structures are an immense number ofother much tinier elementary particles which are themselves universes at the next level and so onforever an infinite downward regression universes within universes endlessly And upward aswell For most of us it is a world that surpasses understanding To read even an elementary guide toparticle physics nowadays you must now find your way through lexical thickets such as this Thecharged pion and antipion decay respectively into a muon plus antineutrino and an antimuon plusneutrino with an average lifetime of x seconds the neutral pion decays into two photonswith an average lifetime of about x seconds and the muon and antimuon decay respectivelyinto And so it runs on and this from a book for the general reader by one of the normally mostlucid of interpreters Steven Weinberg In the s in an attempt to bring just a little simplicity to matters the Caltech physicist MurrayGell Mann invented a new class of particles essentially in the words of Steven Weinberg torestore some economy to the multitude of hadrons a collective term used by physicists for protons neutrons and other particles governed by the strong nuclear force Gell Mann's theory was that allhadrons were made up of still smaller even more fundamental particles His colleague RichardFeynman wanted to call these new basic particles partons as in Dolly but was overruled Insteadthey became known as quarks Gell Mann took the name from a line in Finnegans Wake Three quarks for Muster Mark Discriminating physicists rhyme the word with storks not larks even though the latter is almostcertainly the pronunciation Joyce had in mind The fundamental simplicity of quarks was not longlived As they became better understood it was necessary to introduce subdivisions Although quarksare much too small to have color or taste or any other physical characteristics we would recognize they became clumped into six categories up down strange charm top and bottom whichphysicists oddly refer to as their flavors and these are further divided into the colors red green and blue One suspects that it was not altogether coincidental that these terms were first applied inCalifornia during the age of psychedelia Eventually out of all this emerged what is called the Standard_Model which is essentially a sort ofparts kit for the subatomic world The Standard_Model consists of six quarks six leptons five knownbosons and a postulated sixth the Higgs boson named for a Scottish scientist Peter Higgs plusthree of the four physical forces the strong and weak nuclear forces and electromagnetism The arrangement essentially is that among the basic building blocks of matter are quarks these areheld together by particles called gluons and together quarks and gluons form protons and neutrons the stuff of the atom's nucleus Leptons are the source of electrons and neutrinos Quarks and leptonstogether are called fermions Bosons named for the Indian physicist S N Bose are particles thatproduce and carry forces and include photons and gluons The Higgs boson may or may not actuallyexist it was invented simply as a way of endowing particles with mass It is all as you can see just a little unwieldy but it is the simplest model that can explain all thathappens in the world of particles Most particle physicists feel as Leon Lederman remarked in a PBS documentary that the Standard_Model lacks elegance and simplicity It is toocomplicated It has too many arbitrary parameters Lederman said We don't really see the creatortwiddling twenty knobs to set twenty parameters to create the universe as we know it Physics isreally nothing more than a search for ultimate simplicity but so far all we have is a kind of elegantmessiness or as Lederman put it There is a deep feeling that the picture is not beautiful The Standard_Model is not only ungainly but incomplete For one thing it has nothing at all to sayabout gravity Search through the Standard_Model as you will and you won't find anything to explainwhy when you place a hat on a table it doesn't float up to the ceiling Nor as we've just noted can itexplain mass In order to give particles any mass at all we have to introduce the notional Higgsboson whether it actually exists is a matter for twenty first century physics As Feynman cheerfullyobserved So we are stuck with a theory and we do not know whether it is right or wrong but wedo know that it is a little wrong or at_least incomplete In an attempt to draw everything together physicists have come up with something calledsuperstring theory This postulates that all those little things like quarks and leptons that we hadpreviously thought of as particles are actually strings vibrating strands of energy that oscillate ineleven dimensions consisting of the three we know already plus time and seven other dimensions thatare well unknowable to us The strings are very tiny tiny enough to pass for point particles By introducing extra dimensions superstring theory enables physicists to pull together quantumlaws and gravitational ones into one comparatively tidy package but it also means that anythingscientists say about the theory begins to sound worryingly like the sort of thoughts that would makeyou edge away if conveyed to you by a stranger on a park bench Here for example is the physicistMichio Kaku explaining the structure of the universe from a superstring perspective The heteroticstring consists of a closed string that has two types of vibrations clockwise and counterclockwise which are treated differently The clockwise vibrations live in a ten dimensional space Thecounterclockwise live in a twenty six dimensional space of which sixteen dimensions have beencompactified We recall that in Kaluza's original five dimensional the fifth dimension wascompactified by being wrapped up into a circle And so it goes for some pages String theory has further spawned something called M theory which incorporates surfacesknown as membranes or simply branes to the hipper souls of the world of physics I'm_afraid thisis the stop on the knowledge highway where most of us must get off Here is a sentence from the NewYork Times explaining this as simply as possible to a general audience The ekpyrotic processbegins far in the indefinite past with a pair of flat empty branes sitting parallel to each other in awarped five dimensional space The two branes which form the walls of the fifth dimension could have popped out of nothingness as a quantum fluctuation in the even more distant past and thendrifted apart No arguing with that No understanding it either Ekpyrotic incidentally comes fromthe Greek_word for conflagration Matters in physics have now reached such a pitch that as Paul Davies noted in Nature it is almost impossible for the non scientist to discriminate between the legitimately weird and theoutright crackpot The question came interestingly to a head in the fall of when two Frenchphysicists twin brothers Igor and Grickha Bogdanov produced a theory of ambitious densityinvolving such concepts as imaginary time and the Kubo Schwinger Martin condition andpurporting to describe the nothingness that was the universe before the Big_Bang a period that wasalways assumed to be unknowable since it predated the birth of physics and its properties Almost at once the Bogdanov paper excited debate among physicists as to whether it was twaddle a work of genius or a hoax Scientifically it's clearly more or less complete nonsense ColumbiaUniversity physicist Peter Woit told the New_York_Times but these days that doesn't muchdistinguish it from a lot of the rest of the literature Karl Popper whom Steven Weinberg has called the dean of modern philosophers of science once suggested that there may not be an ultimate theory for physics that rather every explanationmay require a further explanation producing an infinite chain of more and more fundamentalprinciples A rival possibility is that such knowledge may simply be beyond us So far fortunately writes Weinberg in Dreams of a Final_Theory we do not seem to be coming to the endof our intellectual resources Almost certainly this is an area that will see further developments of thought and almost certainlythese thoughts will again be beyond most of us While physicists in the middle decades of the twentieth_century were looking perplexedly into theworld of the very small astronomers were finding no less arresting an incompleteness ofunderstanding in the universe at large When we last met Edwin Hubble he had determined that nearly all the galaxies in our field ofview are flying away from us and that the speed and distance of this retreat are neatly proportional the farther away the galaxy the faster it is moving Hubble realized that this could be expressed witha simple equation Ho v d where Ho is the constant v is the recessional velocity of a flying galaxy and d its distance away from us Ho has been known ever_since as the Hubble constant and the wholeas Hubble's Law Using his formula Hubble calculated that the universe was about two billion yearsold which was a little awkward because even by the late_s it was fairly obvious that manythings within the universe not least Earth itself were probably older than that Refining this figurehas been an ongoing preoccupation of cosmology Almost the only thing constant about the Hubble constant has been the amount of disagreement overwhat value to give it In astronomers discovered that Cepheid variables were more variablethan they had thought they came in two varieties not one This allowed them to rework theircalculations and come up with a new age for the universe of from to billion years not terriblyprecise but at_least old enough at last to embrace the formation of the Earth In the years that followed there erupted a long running dispute between Allan Sandage heir toHubble at Mount Wilson and G rard de Vaucouleurs a French born astronomer based at theUniversity of Texas Sandage after years of careful calculations arrived at a value for the Hubbleconstant of giving the universe an age of billion years De Vaucouleurs was equally certain thatthe Hubble constant was This would mean that the universe was only half the size and age thatSandage believed ten billion years Matters took a further lurch into uncertainty when in ateam from the Carnegie Observatories in California using measures from the Hubble space telescope suggested that the universe could be as little as eight billion years_old an age even they concededwas younger than some of the stars within the universe In February a team from NASA and theGoddard Space Flight Center in Maryland using a new far reaching type of satellite called theWilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe announced with some confidence that the age of the universeis billion years give or take a hundred million_years or so There matters rest at_least for themoment The difficulty in making final determinations is that there are often acres of room for interpretation Imagine standing in a field at night and trying to decide how far away two distant electric lights are Using fairly straightforward tools of astronomy you can easily enough determine that the bulbs are ofequal brightness and that one is say percent more distant than the other But what you can't becertain of is whether the nearer light is let us say a watt bulb that is feet away or a wattlight that is feet inches away On top of that you must make allowances for distortions causedby variations in the Earth's atmosphere by intergalactic dust contaminating light from foregroundstars and many other factors The upshot is that your computations are necessarily based on a seriesof nested assumptions any of which could be a source of contention There is also the problem thataccess to telescopes is always at a premium and historically measuring red shifts has been notablycostly in telescope time It could take all night to get a single exposure In consequence astronomershave sometimes been compelled or willing to base conclusions on notably scanty evidence Incosmology as the journalist Geoffrey Carr has suggested we have a mountain of theory built on amolehill of evidence Or as Martin Rees has put it Our present satisfaction with our state ofunderstanding may reflect the paucity of the data rather than the excellence of the theory This uncertainty applies incidentally to relatively nearby things as much as to the distant edges ofthe universe As Donald Goldsmith notes when astronomers say that the galaxy M is millionlight years away what they really mean but do not often stress to the general public is that it issomewhere between million and million light years away not quite the same thing For theuniverse at large matters are naturally magnified Bearing all that in mind the best bets these days forthe age of the universe seem to be fixed on a range of about billion to billion years but weremain a long way from unanimity One interesting recently suggested theory is that the universe is not nearly as big as we thought thatwhen we peer into the distance some of the galaxies we see may simply be reflections ghost imagescreated by rebounded light The fact is there is a great_deal even at quite a fundamental level that we_don't_know not leastwhat the universe is made of When scientists calculate the amount of matter needed to hold thingstogether they always come up desperately short It appears that at_least percent of the universe and perhaps as much as percent is composed of Fritz Zwicky's dark matter stuff that is by itsnature invisible to us It is slightly galling to think that we live in a universe that for the most part wecan't even see but there you are At least the names for the two main possible culprits areentertaining they are said to be either WIMPs for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles which is tosay specks of invisible matter left over from the Big_Bang or MACHOs for MAssive Compact HaloObjects really just another name for black holes brown dwarfs and other very dim stars Particle physicists have tended to favor the particle explanation of WIMPs astrophysicists thestellar explanation of MACHOs For a time MACHOs had the upper hand but not nearly enough ofthem were found so sentiment swung back toward WIMPs but with the problem that no WIMP hasever been found Because they are weakly interacting they are assuming they even exist very hard todetect Cosmic rays would cause too much interference So scientists must go deep underground Onekilometer underground cosmic bombardments would be one millionth what they would be on thesurface But even when all these are added in two_thirds of the universe is still missing from thebalance sheet as one commentator has put it For the moment we might very well call themDUNNOS for Dark Unknown Nonreflective Nondetectable Objects Somewhere Recent evidence suggests that not only are the galaxies of the universe racing away from us but thatthey are doing so at a rate that is accelerating This is counter to all expectations It appears that theuniverse may not only be filled with dark matter but with dark energy Scientists sometimes also callit vacuum energy or more exotically quintessence Whatever it is it seems to be driving anexpansion that no one can altogether account for The theory is that empty space isn't so empty at all that there are particles of matter and antimatter popping into existence and popping out again andthat these are pushing the universe outward at an accelerating rate Improbably enough the one thingthat resolves all this is Einstein's cosmological constant the little piece of math he dropped into thegeneral theory of relativity to stop the universe's presumed expansion and called the biggest blunderof my life It now appears that he may have gotten things right after all The upshot of all this is that we live in a universe whose age we can't quite compute surroundedby stars whose distances we don't altogether know filled with matter we can't identify operating inconformance with physical laws whose properties we don't truly understand And on that rather unsettling note let's return to Planet Earth and consider something that we dounderstand though by now you perhaps won't be surprised to hear that we don't understand itcompletely and what we do understand we haven't understood for long THE EARTH MOVESIN ONE OF his last professional acts before his death in Albert Einstein wrote a short butglowing foreword to a book by a geologist_named Charles Hapgood entitled named Charles Hapgoodentitled Earth's Shifting Crust A Key to Some Basic Problems of Earth Science Hapgood's bookwas a steady demolition of the idea that continents were in motion In a tone that all but invited thereader to join him in a tolerant chuckle Hapgood observed that a few gullible souls had noticed anapparent correspondence in shape between certain continents It would appear he went on thatSouth America might be fitted together with Africa and so on It is even claimed that rockformations on opposite sides of the Atlantic match Mr Hapgood briskly dismissed any such notions noting that the geologists K E Caster and J C Mendes had done extensive fieldwork on both_sides of the Atlantic and had established beyondquestion that no such similarities existed Goodness knows what outcrops Messrs Caster and Mendeshad looked at beacuse in fact many of the rock formations on both_sides of the Atlantic are the same not just very similar but the same This was not an idea that flew with Mr Hapgood or many other geologists of his day The theoryHapgood alluded to was one first propounded in by an amateur American geologist namedFrank Bursley Taylor Taylor came from a wealthy family and had both the means and freedom fromacademic constraints to pursue unconventional lines of inquiry He was one of those struck by thesimilarity in shape between the facing coastlines of Africa and South_America and from thisobservation he developed the idea that the continents had once slid around He suggested presciently as it turned_out that the crunching together of continents could have thrust up the world'smountain chains He failed however to produce much in the way of evidence and the theory wasconsidered too crackpot to merit serious attention In Germany however Taylor's idea was picked up and effectively appropriated by a theoristnamed Alfred Wegener a meteorologist at the University of Marburg Wegener investigated the manyplant and fossil anomalies that did not fit comfortably into the standard model of Earth history andrealized that very little of it made sense if conventionally interpreted Animal fossils repeatedlyturned up on opposite sides of oceans that were clearly too wide to swim How he wondered didmarsupials travel from South_America to Australia How did identical snails turn up in Scandinaviaand New_England And how come to that did one account for coal seams and other semi tropicalremnants in frigid spots like Spitsbergen four_hundred miles north of Norway if they had notsomehow migrated there from warmer climes Wegener developed the theory that the world's continents had once come together in a singlelandmass he called Pangaea where flora and fauna had been able to mingle before the continents hadsplit apart and floated off to their present positions All this he put together in a book called DieEntstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane or The Origin of Continents and Oceans which waspublished in German in and despite the outbreak of the First World_War in the meantime inEnglish three years later Because of the war Wegener's theory didn't attract much notice at first but by when heproduced a revised and expanded edition it quickly became a subject of discussion Everyone agreedthat continents moved but up and down not sideways The process of vertical movement known asisostasy was a foundation of geological beliefs for generations though no one had any good theoriesas to how or why it happened One idea which remained in textbooks well into my own school days was the baked apple theory propounded by the Austrian Eduard Suess just before the turn of thecentury This suggested that as the molten Earth had cooled it had become wrinkled in the manner ofa baked apple creating ocean basins and mountain ranges Never mind that James Hutton had shownlong before that any such static arrangement would eventually result in a featureless spheroid aserosion leveled the bumps and filled in the divots There was also the problem demonstrated byRutherford and Soddy early in the century that Earthly elements hold huge reserves of heat muchtoo much to allow for the sort of cooling and shrinking Suess suggested And anyway if Suess'stheory was correct then mountains should be evenly distributed across the face of the Earth whichpatently they were not and of more or less the same ages yet by the early_s it was alreadyevident that some ranges like the Urals and Appalachians were hundreds of millions of years olderthan others like the Alps and Rockies Clearly the time was ripe for a new theory Unfortunately Alfred Wegener was not the man that geologists wished to provide it For a start his radical notions questioned the foundations of their discipline seldom an effectiveway to generate warmth in an audience Such a challenge would have been painful enough comingfrom a geologist but Wegener had no background in geology He was a meteorologist for goodnesssake A weatherman a German weatherman These were not remediable deficiencies And so geologists took every pain they could think of to dismiss his evidence and belittle hissuggestions To get around the problems of fossil distributions they posited ancient land bridges wherever they were needed When an ancient horse named Hipparion was found to have lived inFrance and Florida at the same time a land bridge was drawn across the Atlantic When it wasrealized that ancient tapirs had existed simultaneously in South_America and Southeast Asia a landbridge was drawn there too Soon maps of prehistoric seas were almost solid with hypothesized landbridges from North_America to Europe from Brazil to Africa from Southeast Asia to Australia from Australia to Antarctica These connective tendrils had not only conveniently appeared wheneverit was necessary to move a living organism from one landmass to another but then obliginglyvanished without leaving a trace of their former existence None of this of course was supported byso much as a grain of actual evidence nothing so wrong could be yet it was geological orthodoxyfor the next half century Even land bridges couldn't explain some things One species of trilobite that was well known inEurope was also found to have lived on Newfoundland but only on one side No one couldpersuasively explain how it had managed to cross two thousand miles of hostile ocean but then failedto find its way around the corner of a mile wide island Even more awkwardly anomalous wasanother species of trilobite found in Europe and the Pacific Northwest but nowhere in between whichwould have required not so much a land bridge as a flyover Yet as late as when theEncyclopaedia Britannica discussed the rival theories it was Wegener's that was held to be full of numerous grave theoretical difficulties To be sure Wegener made mistakes He asserted that Greenland is drifting west by about a mile ayear which is clearly nonsense It's more like half an inch Above_all he could offer no convincingexplanation for how the landmasses moved about To believe in his theory you had to accept thatmassive continents somehow pushed through solid crust like a plow through soil without leaving anyfurrow in their wake Nothing then known could plausibly explain what motored these massivemovements It was Arthur Holmes the English geologist who did so much to determine the age of the Earth who suggested a possible way Holmes was the first scientist to understand that radioactive warmingcould produce convection currents within the Earth In theory these could be powerful enough to slidecontinents around on the surface In his popular and influential textbook Principles of PhysicalGeology first published in Holmes laid out a continental drift theory that was in itsfundamentals the theory that prevails today It was still a radical proposition for the time and widelycriticized particularly in the United_States where resistance to drift lasted longer than elsewhere One reviewer there fretted without any evident sense of irony that Holmes presented his argumentsso clearly and compellingly that students might actually come to believe them Elsewhere however the new theory drew steady if cautious support In a vote at the annualmeeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science showed that about half of thosepresent now embraced the idea of continental drift Hapgood soon_after cited this figure as proof ofhow tragically misled British geologists had become Curiously Holmes himself sometimeswavered in his conviction In he confessed I have never succeeded in freeing myself from anagging prejudice against continental drift in my geological bones so to speak I feel the hypothesisis a fantastic one Continental drift was not entirely without support in the United_States Reginald Daly of Harvardspoke for it but he you may recall was the man who suggested that the Moon had been formed by acosmic impact and his ideas tended to be considered interesting even worthy but a touch tooexuberant for serious consideration And so most American academics stuck to the belief that thecontinents had occupied their present positions forever and that their surface features could beattributed to something other than lateral motions Interestingly oil company geologists had known for years that if you wanted to find oil you had toallow for precisely the sort of surface movements that were implied by plate_tectonics But oilgeologists didn't write academic papers they just found oil There was one other major problem with Earth theories that no one had resolved or even come closeto resolving That was the question of where all the sediments went Every year Earth's rivers carriedmassive volumes of eroded material million tons of calcium for_instance to the seas If youmultiplied the rate of deposition by the number of years it had been going on it produced a disturbingfigure there should be about twelve miles of sediments on the ocean bottoms or put another way the ocean bottoms should by now be well above the ocean tops Scientists dealt with this paradox inthe handiest possible way They ignored it But eventually there came a point when they could ignoreit no_longer In the Second World_War a Princeton University mineralogist named Harry Hess was put incharge of an attack transport ship the USS Cape Johnson Aboard this vessel was a fancy new depthsounder called a fathometer which was designed to facilitate inshore maneuvers during beachlandings but Hess realized that it could equally well be used for scientific purposes and neverswitched it off even when far out at sea even in the heat of battle What he found was entirelyunexpected If the ocean floors were ancient as everyone assumed they should be thickly blanketedwith sediments like the mud on the bottom of a river or lake But Hess's readings showed that theocean floor offered anything but the gooey smoothness of ancient silts It was scored everywhere withcanyons trenches and crevasses and dotted with volcanic seamounts that he called guyots after anearlier Princeton geologist_named Arnold Guyot All this was a puzzle but Hess had a war to takepart in and put such thoughts to the back of his mind After the war Hess returned to Princeton and the preoccupations of teaching but the mysteries ofthe seafloor continued to occupy a space in his thoughts Meanwhile throughout the soceanographers were undertaking more and more sophisticated surveys of the ocean floors In sodoing they found an even bigger surprise the mightiest and most extensive mountain range on Earthwas mostly underwater It traced a continuous path along the world's seabeds rather like thestitching on a baseball If you began at Iceland you could follow it down the center of the AtlanticOcean around the bottom of Africa and across the Indian and Southern Oceans below Australia there it angled across the Pacific as if making for Baja California before shooting up the west coast ofthe United_States to Alaska Occasionally its higher peaks poked above the water as an island orarchipelago the Azores and Canaries in the Atlantic Hawaii in the Pacific for_instance but mostlyit was buried under thousands of fathoms of salty sea unknown and unsuspected When all itsbranches were added together the network extended to miles A very little of this had been known for some time People laying ocean floor cables in thenineteenth century had realized that there was some kind of mountainous intrusion in the mid Atlanticfrom the way the cables ran but the continuous nature and overall scale of the chain was a stunningsurprise Moreover it contained physical anomalies that couldn't be explained Down the middle ofthe mid Atlantic ridge was a canyon a rift up to a dozen miles wide for its entire milelength This seemed to suggest that the Earth was splitting apart at the seams like a nut bursting out ofits shell It was an absurd and unnerving notion but the evidence couldn't be denied Then in core samples showed that the ocean floor was quite young at the mid Atlantic ridgebut grew progressively older as you moved away from it to the east or west Harry Hess consideredthe matter and realized that this could mean only one thing new ocean crust was being formed oneither side of the central rift then being pushed away from it as new crust came along behind TheAtlantic floor was effectively two large conveyor belts one carrying crust toward North_America theother carrying crust toward Europe The process became known as seafloor spreading When the crust reached the end of its journey at the boundary with continents it plunged back intothe Earth in a process known as subduction That explained where all the sediment went It was beingreturned to the bowels of the Earth It also explained why ocean floors everywhere were socomparatively youthful None had ever been found to be older than about million_years whichwas a puzzle because continental rocks were often billions of years_old Now Hess could see why Ocean rocks lasted only as long as it took them to travel to shore It was a beautiful theory thatexplained a great_deal Hess elaborated his ideas in an important paper which was almostuniversally ignored Sometimes the world just isn't ready for a good idea Meanwhile two researchers working independently were making some startling findings bydrawing on a curious fact of Earth history that had been discovered several decades earlier In a French physicist named Bernard Brunhes had found that the planet's magnetic_field reverses itselffrom time to time and that the record of these reversals is permanently fixed in certain rocks at thetime of their birth Specifically tiny grains of iron ore within the rocks point to wherever themagnetic poles happen to be at the time of their formation then stay pointing in that direction as therocks cool and harden In effect they remember where the magnetic poles were at the time of theircreation For years this was little more than a curiosity but in the s Patrick Blackett of theUniversity of London and S K Runcorn of the University of Newcastle studied the ancient magneticpatterns frozen in British rocks and were startled to say the very least to find them indicating that atsome time in the distant past Britain had spun on its axis and traveled some distance to the north as ifit had somehow come loose from its moorings Moreover they also discovered that if you placed amap of Europe's magnetic patterns alongside an American one from the same period they fit togetheras neatly as two halves of a torn letter It was uncanny Their findings were ignored too It finally fell to two men from Cambridge University a geophysicist named Drummond Matthewsand a graduate_student of his named Fred Vine to draw all the strands together In usingmagnetic studies of the Atlantic Ocean floor they demonstrated conclusively that the seafloors werespreading in precisely the manner Hess had suggested and that the continents were in motion too Anunlucky Canadian geologist_named Lawrence Morley came up with the same conclusion at the sametime but couldn't find anyone to publish his paper In what has become a famous snub the editor ofthe Journal of Geophysical Research told him Such speculations make interesting talk at cocktailparties but it is not the sort of thing that ought to be published under serious scientific aegis Onegeologist later described it as probably the most significant paper in the earth sciences ever to bedenied publication At all events mobile crust was an idea whose time had finally come A symposium of many of themost important figures in the field was convened in London under the auspices of the Royal_Society in and suddenly it seemed everyone was a convert The Earth the meeting agreed was a mosaicof interconnected segments whose various stately jostlings accounted for much of the planet's surfacebehavior The name continental drift was fairly swiftly discarded when it was realized that the whole crustwas in motion and not just the continents but it took a while to settle on a name for the individualsegments At first people called them crustal blocks or sometimes paving stones Not_until late with the publication of an article by three American seismologists in the Journal ofGeophysical Research did the segments receive the name by which they have since been known plates The same article called the new science plate_tectonics Old ideas die hard and not everyone rushed to embrace the exciting new theory Well into the s one of the most popular and influential geological textbooks The Earth by the venerableHarold Jeffreys strenuously insisted that plate_tectonics was a physical impossibility just as it had inthe first edition way back in It was equally dismissive of convection and seafloor spreading And in Basin and Range published in John McPhee noted that even then one Americangeologist in eight still didn't believe in plate_tectonics Today we know that Earth's surface is made up of eight to twelve big plates depending on howyou define big and twenty or so smaller ones and they all move in different directions and atdifferent speeds Some plates are large and comparatively inactive others small but energetic Theybear only an incidental relationship to the landmasses that sit upon them The North American plate for_instance is much larger than the continent with which it is associated It roughly traces the outlineof the continent's western coast which is why that area is so seismically active because of the bumpand crush of the plate boundary but ignores the eastern seaboard altogether and instead extendshalfway across the Atlantic to the mid ocean ridge Iceland is split down the middle which makes ittectonically half American and half European New_Zealand meanwhile is part of the immenseIndian Ocean plate even though it is nowhere near the Indian Ocean And so it goes for most plates The connections between modern landmasses and those of the past were found to be infinitely morecomplex than anyone had imagined Kazakhstan it turns_out was once attached to Norway and NewEngland One corner of Staten Island but only a corner is European So is part of Newfoundland Pick up a pebble from a Massachusetts beach and its nearest kin will now be in Africa The ScottishHighlands and much of Scandinavia are substantially American Some of the Shackleton Range ofAntarctica it is thought may once have belonged to the Appalachians of the eastern U_S Rocks inshort get around The constant turmoil keeps the plates from fusing into a single immobile plate Assuming thingscontinue much as at present the Atlantic Ocean will expand until eventually it is much bigger_than thePacific Much of California will float off and become a kind of Madagascar of the Pacific Africawill push northward into Europe squeezing the Mediterranean out of existence and thrusting up achain of mountains of Himalayan majesty running from Paris to Calcutta Australia will colonize theislands to its north and connect by some isthmian umbilicus to Asia These are future outcomes butnot future events The events are happening now As we sit here continents are adrift like leaves on apond Thanks to Global Positioning Systems we can see that Europe and North_America are parting atabout the speed a fingernail grows roughly two yards in a human lifetime If you were prepared towait long enough you could ride from Los Angeles all the way up to San Francisco It is only thebrevity of lifetimes that keeps us from appreciating the changes Look at a globe and what you areseeing really is a snapshot of the continents as they have been for just one tenth of percent of theEarth's history Earth is alone among the rocky planets in having tectonics and why this should be is a bit of amystery It is not simply a matter of size or density Venus is nearly a twin of Earth in these respectsand yet has no tectonic activity It is thought though it is really nothing more than a thought thattectonics is an important part of the planet's organic well being As the physicist and writer JamesTrefil has put it It would be hard to believe that the continuous movement of tectonic plates has noeffect on the development of life on earth He suggests that the challenges induced by tectonics changes in climate for_instance were an important spur to the development of intelligence Othersbelieve the driftings of the continents may have produced at_least some of the Earth's variousextinction events In November of Tony Dickson of Cambridge University in England produceda report published in the journal Science strongly suggesting that there may well be a relationshipbetween the history of rocks and the history of life What Dickson established was that the chemicalcomposition of the world's oceans has altered abruptly and vigorously throughout the past half billionyears and that these changes often correlate with important events in biological history the hugeoutburst of tiny organisms that created the chalk cliffs of England's south coast the sudden fashion forshells among marine organisms during the Cambrian_period and so on No one can say what causesthe oceans' chemistry to change so dramatically from time to time but the opening and shutting ofocean ridges would be an obvious possible culprit At all events plate_tectonics not only explained the surface dynamics of the Earth how an ancientHipparion got from France to Florida for example but also many of its internal actions Earthquakes the formation of island chains the carbon cycle the locations of mountains the comingof ice_ages the origins of life itself there was hardly a matter that wasn't directly influenced by thisremarkable new theory Geologists as McPhee has noted found themselves in the giddying positionthat the whole earth suddenly made sense But only up to a point The distribution of continents in former times is much less neatly resolvedthan most people outside geophysics think Although textbooks give confident looking representationsof ancient landmasses with names like Laurasia Gondwana Rodinia and Pangaea these aresometimes based on conclusions that don't altogether hold up As George Gaylord Simpson observesin Fossils and the History of Life species of plants and animals from the ancient world have a habitof appearing inconveniently where they shouldn't and failing to be where they ought The outline of Gondwana a once mighty continent connecting Australia Africa Antarctica andSouth America was based in large part on the distribution of a genus of ancient tongue fern calledGlossopteris which was found in all the right places However much later Glossopteris was alsodiscovered in parts of the world that had no known connection to Gondwana This troublingdiscrepancy was and continues to be mostly ignored Similarly a Triassic reptile calledLystrosaurus has been found from Antarctica all the way to Asia supporting the idea of a formerconnection between those continents but it has never turned up in South_America or Australia whichare believed to have been part of the same continent at the same time There are also many surface features that tectonics can't explain Take Denver It is as everyoneknows a mile high but that rise is comparatively recent When dinosaurs roamed the Earth Denverwas part of an ocean bottom many thousands of feet lower Yet the rocks on which Denver sits arenot fractured or deformed in the way they would be if Denver had been pushed up by colliding plates and anyway Denver was too far from the plate edges to be susceptible to their actions It would be asif you pushed against the edge of a rug hoping to raise a ruck at the opposite end Mysteriously andover millions of years it appears that Denver has been rising like baking bread So too has much ofsouthern Africa a portion of it a thousand miles across has risen nearly a mile in million yearswithout any known associated tectonic activity Australia meanwhile has been tilting and sinking Over the past million_years as it has drifted north toward Asia its leading edge has sunk by somesix hundred feet It appears that Indonesia is very slowly drowning and dragging Australia down withit Nothing in the theories of tectonics can explain any of this Alfred Wegener never lived to see his ideas vindicated On an expedition to Greenland in heset out alone on his fiftieth birthday to check out a supply drop He never returned He was found afew days later frozen to death on the ice He was buried on the spot and lies there yet but about ayard closer to North_America than on the day he died Einstein also failed to live long enough to see that he had backed the wrong horse In_fact he diedat Princeton New_Jersey in before Charles Hapgood's rubbishing of continental drift theorieswas even published The other principal player in the emergence of tectonics theory Harry Hess was also at Princetonat the time and would spend the rest of his career there One of his students was a bright youngfellow named Walter Alvarez who would eventually change the world of science in a quite differentway As for geology itself its cataclysms had only just begun and it was young Alvarez who helped tostart the process PART IV DANGEROUS PLANET BANG PEOPLE KNEW FOR a long time that there was something odd about the earth beneath Manson Iowa In a man drilling a well for the town water supply reported bringing up a lot of strangelydeformed rock crystalline clast breccia with a melt matrix and overturned ejecta flap as it waslater described in an official report The water was odd too It was almost as soft as rainwater Naturally occurring soft water had never been found in Iowa before Though Manson's strange rocks and silken waters were matters of curiosity forty one years wouldpass before a team from the University of Iowa got around to making a trip to the community then asnow a town of about two thousand people in the northwest part of the state In after sinking aseries of experimental bores university geologists agreed that the site was indeed anomalous andattributed the deformed rocks to some ancient unspecified volcanic action This was in keeping withthe wisdom of the day but it was also about as wrong as a geological conclusion can get The trauma to Manson's geology had come not from within the Earth but from at_least millionmiles beyond Sometime in the very ancient past when Manson stood on the edge of a shallow sea arock about a mile and a half across weighing ten billion_tons and traveling at perhaps two hundredtimes the speed of sound ripped through the atmosphere and punched into the Earth with a violenceand suddenness that we can scarcely imagine Where Manson now stands became in an instant a holethree miles deep and more than twenty miles across The limestone that elsewhere gives Iowa its hardmineralized water was obliterated and replaced by the shocked basement rocks that so puzzled thewater driller in The Manson impact was the biggest thing that has ever occurred on the mainland United_States Ofany type Ever The crater it left_behind was so colossal that if you stood on one edge you would onlyjust be able to see the other side on a good day It would make the Grand Canyon look quaint andtrifling Unfortunately for lovers of spectacle million_years of passing ice_sheets filled theManson crater right to the top with rich glacial till then graded it smooth so that today the landscapeat Manson and for miles around is as flat as a tabletop Which is of course why no one has everheard of the Manson crater At the library in Manson they are delighted to show you a collection of newspaper articles and abox of core samples from a drilling program indeed they positively bustle to producethem but you have to ask to see them Nothing permanent is on display and nowhere in the town isthere any historical marker To most people in Manson the biggest thing ever to happen was a tornado that rolled up MainStreet in tearing apart the business district One of the advantages of all that surroundingflatness is that you can see danger from a long way off Virtually the whole town turned_out at one endof Main Street and watched for half an_hour as the tornado came toward them hoping it would veeroff then prudently scampered when it did not Four of them alas didn't move quite fast enough andwere killed Every June now Manson has a weeklong event called Crater Days which was dreamedup as a way of helping people forget that unhappy anniversary It doesn't really have anything to dowith the crater Nobody's figured out a way to capitalize on an impact_site that isn't visible Very occasionally we get people coming in and asking where they should go to see the crater andwe have to tell them that there is nothing to see says Anna Schlapkohl the town's friendly librarian Then they go away kind of disappointed However most people including most Iowans havenever heard of the Manson crater Even for geologists it barely rates a footnote But for one briefperiod in the s Manson was the most geologically exciting place on Earth The story begins in the early_s when a bright young geologist_named Eugene Shoemaker paid avisit to Meteor_Crater in Arizona Today Meteor_Crater is the most famous impact_site on Earth and apopular tourist attraction In those days however it didn't receive many visitors and was still oftenreferred to as Barringer Crater after a wealthy mining engineer named Daniel M Barringer who hadstaked a claim on it in Barringer believed that the crater had been formed by a ten million tonmeteor heavily freighted with iron and nickel and it was his confident expectation that he wouldmake a fortune digging it out Unaware that the meteor and everything in it would have been vaporizedon impact he wasted a fortune and the next twenty six years cutting tunnels that yielded nothing By the standards of today crater research in the early_s was a trifle unsophisticated to say theleast The leading early investigator G K Gilbert of Columbia University modeled the effects ofimpacts by flinging marbles into pans of oatmeal For reasons I cannot supply Gilbert conductedthese experiments not in a laboratory at Columbia but in a hotel room Somehow from this Gilbertconcluded that the Moon's craters were indeed formed by impacts in itself quite a radical notion forthe time but that the Earth's were not Most scientists refused to go even that far To them theMoon's craters were evidence of ancient volcanoes and nothing more The few craters that remainedevident on Earth most had been eroded away were generally attributed to other causes or treated asfluky rarities By the time Shoemaker came along a common view was that Meteor_Crater had been formed by anunderground steam explosion Shoemaker knew nothing about underground steam explosions hecouldn't they don't exist but he did know all about blast zones One of his first jobs out of collegewas to study explosion rings at the Yucca Flats nuclear test site in Nevada He concluded asBarringer had before him that there was nothing at Meteor_Crater to suggest volcanic activity but thatthere were huge distributions of other stuff anomalous fine silicas and magnetites principally thatsuggested an impact from space Intrigued he began to study the subject in his spare time Working first with his colleague Eleanor Helin and later with his wife Carolyn and associateDavid Levy Shoemaker began a systematic survey of the inner solar_system They spent one weekeach month at the Palomar Observatory in California looking for objects asteroids primarily whosetrajectories carried them across Earth's orbit At the time we started only slightly more than a dozen of these things had ever been discovered inthe entire course of astronomical observation Shoemaker recalled some years later in a televisioninterview Astronomers in the twentieth_century essentially abandoned the solar_system he added Their attention was turned to the stars the galaxies What Shoemaker and his colleagues found was that there was more risk out there a great dealmore than anyone had ever imagined Asteroids as most people know are rocky objects orbiting in loose formation in a belt betweenMars and Jupiter In illustrations they are always shown as existing in a jumble but in fact the solarsystem is quite a roomy place and the average asteroid actually will be about a million miles from itsnearest neighbor Nobody knows even approximately how many asteroids there are tumbling throughspace but the number is thought to be probably not less than a billion They are presumed to beplanets that never quite made it owing to the unsettling gravitational pull of Jupiter which kept andkeeps them from coalescing When asteroids were first detected in the s the very first was discovered on the first day ofthe century by a Sicilian named Giuseppi Piazzi they were thought to be planets and the first twowere named Ceres and Pallas It took some inspired deductions by the astronomer William Herschelto work out that they were nowhere near planet sized but much smaller He called them asteroids Latin for starlike which was slightly unfortunate as they are not like stars at all Sometimes nowthey are more accurately called planetoids Finding asteroids became a popular activity in the s and by the end of the century about athousand were known The problem was that no one was systematically recording them By the early_s it had often become impossible to know whether an asteroid that popped into view was newor simply one that had been noted earlier and then lost track of By this time too astrophysics hadmoved on so much that few astronomers wanted to devote their lives to anything as mundane as rockyplanetoids Only a few astronomers notably Gerard Kuiper the Dutch born astronomer for whom theKuiper belt of comets is named took any interest in the solar_system at all Thanks to his work at theMcDonald Observatory in Texas followed later by work done by others at the Minor Planet Centerin Cincinnati and the Spacewatch project in Arizona a long list of lost asteroids was graduallywhittled down until by the close of the twentieth_century only one known asteroid was unaccountedfor an object called Albert Last seen in October it was finally tracked down in after being missing for eighty nine years So from the point of view of asteroid research the twentieth_century was essentially just a longexercise in bookkeeping It is really only in the last few years that astronomers have begun to countand keep an eye on the rest of the asteroid community As of July twenty six thousand asteroidshad been named and identified half in just the previous two years With up to a billion to identify the count obviously has barely begun In a sense it hardly matters Identifying an asteroid doesn't make it safe Even if every asteroid inthe solar_system had a name and known orbit no one could say what perturbations might send any ofthem hurtling toward us We can't forecast rock disturbances on our_own surface Put them adrift inspace and what they might do is beyond guessing Any asteroid out there that has our name on it isvery likely to have no other Think of the Earth's orbit as a kind of freeway on which we are the only vehicle but which iscrossed regularly by pedestrians who don't_know enough to look before stepping off the curb At least percent of these pedestrians are quite unknown to us We don't_know where they live what sort ofhours they keep how often they come our way All we know is that at some point at uncertainintervals they trundle across the road down which we are cruising at sixty six thousand miles anhour As Steven Ostro of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has put it Suppose that there was a buttonyou could push and you could light up all the Earth crossing asteroids larger than about ten meters there would be over million of these objects in the sky In short you would see not a couple ofthousand distant twinkling stars but millions_upon millions_upon millions of nearer randomly movingobjects all of which are capable of colliding with the Earth and all of which are moving on slightlydifferent courses through the sky at different rates It would be deeply unnerving Well be unnervedbecause it is there We just can't see it Altogether it is thought though it is really only a guess based on extrapolating from crateringrates on the Moon that some two thousand asteroids big enough to imperil civilized existenceregularly cross our orbit But even a small asteroid the size of a house say could destroy a city The number of these relative tiddlers in Earth crossing orbits is almost_certainly in the hundreds ofthousands and possibly in the millions and they are nearly impossible to track The first one wasn't spotted until and that was after it had already gone by Named BA it was noticed as it sailed past us at a distance of miles in cosmic terms the equivalent of abullet passing through one's sleeve without touching the arm Two years later another somewhatlarger asteroid missed us by just miles the closest pass yet recorded It too was not seenuntil it had passed and would have arrived without warning According to Timothy Ferris writing inthe New_Yorker such near misses probably happen two or three times a week and go unnoticed An object a hundred yards across couldn't be picked up by any Earth based telescope until it waswithin just a few days of us and that is only if a telescope happened to be trained on it which isunlikely because even now the number of people searching for such objects is modest The arrestinganalogy that is always made is that the number of people in the world who are actively searching forasteroids is fewer than the staff of a typical McDonald's restaurant It is actually somewhat highernow But not much While Gene Shoemaker was trying to get people galvanized about the potential dangers of the innersolar system another development wholly unrelated on the face of it was quietly unfolding in Italywith the work of a young geologist from the Lamont Doherty Laboratory at Columbia University Inthe early_s Walter Alvarez was doing fieldwork in a comely defile known as the BottaccioneGorge near the Umbrian hill town of Gubbio when he grew curious about a thin band of reddish claythat divided two ancient layers of limestone one from the Cretaceous period the other from theTertiary This is a point known to geology as the KT boundary and it marks the time sixty fivemillion years_ago when the dinosaurs and roughly half the world's other species of animals abruptlyvanish from the fossil_record Alvarez wondered what it was about a thin lamina of clay barely aquarter of an inch thick that could account for such a dramatic moment in Earth's history At the time the conventional wisdom about the dinosaur extinction was the same as it had been inCharles Lyell's day a century earlier namely that the dinosaurs had died out over millions of years But the thinness of the clay layer clearly suggested that in Umbria if nowhere else something rathermore abrupt had happened Unfortunately in the s no tests existed for determining how long sucha deposit might have taken to accumulate In the normal course of things Alvarez almost_certainly would have had to leave the problem atthat but luckily he had an impeccable connection to someone outside his discipline who could help his father Luis Luis Alvarez was an eminent nuclear physicist he had won the Nobel_Prize forphysics the previous decade He had always been mildly scornful of his son's attachment to rocks butthis problem intrigued him It occurred to him that the answer might lie in dust from space Every year the Earth accumulates some thirty thousand metric_tons of cosmic spherules spacedust in plainer language which would be quite a lot if you swept it into one pile but is infinitesimalwhen spread across the globe Scattered through this thin dusting are exotic elements not normallymuch found on Earth Among these is the element iridium which is a thousand times more abundant inspace than in the Earth's_crust because it is thought most of the iridium on Earth sank to the corewhen the planet was young Alvarez knew that a colleague of his at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California FrankAsaro had developed a technique for measuring very precisely the chemical composition of claysusing a process called neutron activation analysis This involved bombarding samples with neutronsin a small nuclear reactor and carefully counting the gamma rays that were emitted it was extremelyfinicky work Previously Asaro had used the technique to analyze pieces of pottery but Alvarezreasoned that if they measured the amount of one of the exotic elements in his son's soil samples andcompared that with its annual rate of deposition they would know how long it had taken the samplesto form On an October afternoon in Luis and Walter Alvarez dropped in on Asaro and askedhim if he would run the necessary tests for them It was really quite a presumptuous request They were asking Asaro to devote months to making themost painstaking measurements of geological samples merely to confirm what seemed entirely selfevident to begin with that the thin layer of clay had been formed as quickly as its thinness suggested Certainly no one expected his survey to yield any dramatic breakthroughs Well they were very charming very persuasive Asaro recalled in an interview in And itseemed an interesting challenge so I agreed to try Unfortunately I had a lot of other work on so itwas eight months before I could get to it He consulted his notes from the period On June at p m we put a sample in the detector It ran for minutes and we could see we were gettinginteresting results so we stopped it and had a look The results were so unexpected in fact that the three scientists at first thought they had to bewrong The amount of iridium in the Alvarez sample was more than three hundred times normal levels far beyond anything they might have predicted Over the following months Asaro and his colleagueHelen Michel worked up to thirty hours at a stretch Once you started you couldn't stop Asaroexplained analyzing samples always with the same results Tests on other samples from Denmark Spain France New_Zealand Antarctica showed that the iridium deposit was worldwide andgreatly elevated everywhere sometimes by as much as five hundred times normal levels Clearlysomething big and abrupt and probably cataclysmic had produced this arresting spike After much thought the Alvarezes concluded that the most plausible explanation plausible tothem at any rate was that the Earth had been struck by an asteroid or comet The idea that the Earth might be subjected to devastating impacts from time to time was not quite asnew as it is now sometimes presented As far back as a Northwestern University astrophysicistnamed Ralph B Baldwin had suggested such a possibility in an article in Popular Astronomymagazine He published the article there because no academic publisher was prepared to run it Andat least two well known scientists the astronomer Ernst pik and the chemist and Nobel laureateHarold Urey had also voiced support for the notion at various times Even among paleontologists itwas not unknown In a professor at Oregon State University M W de Laubenfels writing in theJournal of Paleontology had actually anticipated the Alvarez theory by suggesting that the dinosaursmay have been dealt a death blow by an impact from space and in the president of theAmerican Paleontological Society Dewey J McLaren proposed at the group's annual conference thepossibility that an extraterrestrial impact may have been the cause of an earlier event known as theFrasnian extinction As if to underline just how un novel the idea had become by this time in a Hollywood studioactually produced a movie called Meteor It's five miles wide It's coming at m p h andthere's no place to hide starring Henry Fonda Natalie Wood Karl Malden and a very large rock So when in the first week of at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancementof Science the Alvarezes announced their belief that the dinosaur extinction had not taken place overmillions of years as part of some slow inexorable process but suddenly in a single explosive event itshouldn't have come as a shock But it did It was received everywhere but particularly in the paleontological community as anoutrageous heresy Well you have to remember Asaro recalls that we were amateurs in this field Walter was ageologist specializing in paleomagnetism Luis was a physicist and I was a nuclear chemist And nowhere we were telling paleontologists that we had solved a problem that had eluded them for over acentury It's not terribly surprising that they didn't embrace it immediately As Luis Alvarez joked We were caught practicing geology without a license But there was also something much deeper and more fundamentally abhorrent in the impact theory The belief that terrestrial processes were gradual had been elemental in natural_history since the timeof Lyell By the s catastrophism had been out of fashion for so long that it had become literallyunthinkable For most geologists the idea of a devastating impact was as Eugene Shoemaker noted against their scientific religion Nor did it help that Luis Alvarez was openly contemptuous of paleontologists and theircontributions to scientific knowledge They're really not very good scientists They're more likestamp collectors he wrote in the New_York_Times in an article that stings yet Opponents of the Alvarez theory produced any number of alternative explanations for the iridiumdeposits for_instance that they were generated by prolonged volcanic eruptions in India called theDeccan Traps and above all insisted that there was no proof that the dinosaurs disappeared abruptlyfrom the fossil_record at the iridium boundary One of the most vigorous opponents was CharlesOfficer of Dartmouth College He insisted that the iridium had been deposited by volcanic actioneven while conceding in a newspaper interview that he had no actual evidence of it As late as more than half of all American paleontologists contacted in a survey continued to believe that theextinction of the dinosaurs was in no way related to an asteroid or cometary impact The one thing that would most obviously support the Alvarezes' theory was the one thing they didn'thave an impact_site Enter Eugene Shoemaker Shoemaker had an Iowa connection his daughterin law taught at the University of Iowa and he was familiar with the Manson crater from his ownstudies Thanks to him all eyes now turned to Iowa Geology is a profession that varies from place to place In Iowa a state that is flat andstratigraphically uneventful it tends to be comparatively serene There are no Alpine peaks orgrinding glaciers no great deposits of oil or precious metals not a hint of a pyroclastic flow If youare a geologist employed by the state of Iowa a big part of the work you do is to evaluate ManureManagement Plans which all the state's animal confinement operators hog farmers to the rest ofus are required to file periodically There are fifteen million hogs in Iowa so a lot of manure tomanage I'm not mocking this at all it's vital and enlightened work it keeps Iowa's water clean butwith the best will in the world it's not exactly dodging lava bombs on Mount Pinatubo or scrabblingover crevasses on the Greenland ice_sheet in search of ancient life bearing quartzes So we may wellimagine the flutter of excitement that swept through the Iowa Department of Natural Resources whenin the mid_s the world's geological attention focused on Manson and its crater Trowbridge Hall in Iowa City is a turn of the century pile of red brick that houses the Universityof Iowa's Earth Sciences department and way up in a kind of garret the geologists of the IowaDepartment of Natural Resources No one now can remember quite when still less why the stategeologists were placed in an academic facility but you get the impression that the space wasconceded grudgingly for the offices are cramped and low ceilinged and not very accessible Whenbeing shown the way you half expect to be taken out onto a roof ledge and helped in through awindow Ray Anderson and Brian Witzke spend their working lives up here amid disordered heaps ofpapers journals furled charts and hefty specimen stones Geologists are never at a loss forpaperweights It's the kind of space where if you want to find anything an extra chair a coffee cup a ringing telephone you have to move stacks of documents around Suddenly we were at the center of things Anderson told_me gleaming at the memory of it when Imet him and Witzke in their offices on a dismal rainy morning in June It was a wonderful time I_asked them about Gene Shoemaker a man who seems to have been universally revered He wasjust a great guy Witzke replied without hesitation If it hadn't been for him the whole thing wouldnever have gotten off the ground Even with his support it took two years to get it up and running Drilling's an expensive business about thirty five dollars a foot back then more now and weneeded to go down three thousand feet Sometimes more than that Anderson added Sometimes more than that Witzke agreed And at several locations So you're talking a lot ofmoney Certainly more than our budget would allow So a collaboration was formed between the Iowa Geological Survey and the U_S GeologicalSurvey At least we thought it was a collaboration said Anderson producing a small pained smile It was a real learning curve for us Witzke went on There was actually quite a lot of badscience going on throughout the period people rushing in with results that didn't always stand up toscrutiny One of those moments came at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in when Glenn Izett and C L Pillmore of the U_S Geological Survey announced that the Mansoncrater was of the right age to have been involved with the dinosaurs' extinction The declarationattracted a good deal of press attention but was unfortunately premature A more careful examinationof the data revealed that Manson was not only too small but also nine million_years too early The first Anderson or Witzke learned of this setback to their careers was when they arrived at aconference in South Dakota and found people coming up to them with sympathetic looks and saying We hear you lost your crater It was the first they knew that Izett and the other USGS scientists hadjust announced refined figures revealing that Manson couldn't after all have been the extinction crater It was pretty stunning recalls Anderson I mean we had this thing that was really important andthen suddenly we didn't have it anymore But even worse was the realization that the people wethought we'd been collaborating with hadn't bothered to share with us their new findings Why not He shrugged Who knows Anyway it was a pretty good insight into how unattractive science canget when you're playing at a certain level The search moved elsewhere By chance in one of the searchers Alan Hildebrand of theUniversity of Arizona met a reporter from the Houston Chronicle who happened to know about alarge unexplained ring formation miles wide and miles deep under Mexico's Yucat nPeninsula at Chicxulub near the city of Progreso about miles due south of New Orleans Theformation had been found by Pemex the Mexican oil company in the year coincidentally thatGene Shoemaker first visited Meteor_Crater in Arizona but the company's geologists had concludedthat it was volcanic in line with the thinking of the day Hildebrand traveled to the site and decidedfairly swiftly that they had their crater By early it had been established to nearly everyone'ssatisfaction that Chicxulub was the impact_site Still many people didn't quite grasp what an impact could do As Stephen_Jay Gould recalled inone of his essays I remember harboring some strong initial doubts about the efficacy of such anevent W hy should an object only six miles across wreak such havoc upon a planet with adiameter of eight thousand miles Conveniently a natural test of the theory arose when the Shoemakers and Levy discovered CometShoemaker Levy which they soon realized was headed for Jupiter For the first time humanswould be able to witness a cosmic collision and witness it very well thanks to the new Hubblespace telescope Most astronomers according to Curtis Peebles expected little particularly as thecomet was not a coherent sphere but a string of twenty one fragments My sense wrote one is thatJupiter will swallow these comets up without so much as a burp One week before the impact Nature ran an article The Big Fizzle Is Coming predicting that the impact would constitute nothingmore than a meteor shower The impacts began on July went on for a week and were bigger by far than anyone withthe possible exception of Gene Shoemaker expected One fragment known as Nucleus G struckwith the force of about six million megatons seventy five times more than all the nuclear weaponryin existence Nucleus G was only about the size of a small mountain but it created wounds in theJovian surface the size of Earth It was the final blow for critics of the Alvarez theory Luis Alvarez never knew of the discovery of the Chicxulub crater or of the Shoemaker Levy comet as he died in Shoemaker also died early On the third anniversary of the Shoemaker Levyimpact he and his wife were in the Australian outback where they went every year to search forimpact sites On a dirt track in the Tanami Desert normally one of the emptiest places on Earth they came over a slight rise just as another vehicle was approaching Shoemaker was killed instantly his wife injured Part of his ashes were sent to the Moon aboard the Lunar Prospector spacecraft Therest were scattered around Meteor_Crater Anderson and Witzke no_longer had the crater that killed the dinosaurs but we still had the largestand most perfectly preserved impact crater in the mainland United_States Anderson said A littleverbal dexterity is required to keep Manson's superlative status Other craters are larger notably Chesapeake Bay which was recognized as an impact_site in but they are either offshore ordeformed Chicxulub is buried under two to three kilometers of limestone and mostly offshore which makes it difficult to study Anderson went on while Manson is really quite accessible It'sbecause it is buried that it is actually comparatively pristine I_asked them how much warning we would receive if a similar hunk of rock was coming toward ustoday Oh probably none said Anderson breezily It wouldn't be visible to the naked eye until itwarmed up and that wouldn't happen until it hit the atmosphere which would be about one secondbefore it hit the Earth You're talking_about something moving many tens of times faster than the fastestbullet Unless it had been seen by someone with a telescope and that's by no means a certainty itwould take us completely by surprise How hard an impactor hits depends on a lot of variables angle of entry velocity and trajectory whether the collision is head on or from the side and the mass and density of the impacting object among much else none of which we can know so many millions of years after the fact But whatscientists can do and Anderson and Witzke have done is measure the impact_site and calculate theamount of energy released From that they can work out plausible scenarios of what it must have beenlike or more chillingly would be like if it happened now An asteroid or comet traveling at cosmic velocities would enter the Earth's atmosphere at such aspeed that the air beneath it couldn't get out of the way and would be compressed as in a bicyclepump As anyone who has used such a pump knows compressed air grows swiftly hot and thetemperature below it would rise to some Kelvin or ten times the surface temperature of theSun In this instant of its arrival in our atmosphere everything in the meteor's path people houses factories cars would crinkle and vanish like cellophane in a flame One second after entering the atmosphere the meteorite would slam into the Earth's surface wherethe people of Manson had a moment before been going about their business The meteorite itselfwould vaporize instantly but the blast would blow out a thousand cubic kilometers of rock earth andsuperheated gases Every living thing within miles that hadn't been killed by the heat of entrywould now be killed by the blast Radiating outward at almost the speed of light would be the initialshock wave sweeping everything before it For those outside the zone of immediate devastation the first inkling of catastrophe would be aflash of blinding light the brightest ever seen by human eyes followed an instant to a minute or twolater by an apocalyptic sight of unimaginable grandeur a roiling wall of darkness reaching high intothe heavens filling an entire field of view and traveling at thousands of miles an_hour Its approachwould be eerily silent since it would be moving far beyond the speed of sound Anyone in a tallbuilding in Omaha or Des Moines say who chanced to look in the right direction would see abewildering veil of turmoil followed by instantaneous oblivion Within minutes over an area stretching from Denver to Detroit and encompassing what had oncebeen Chicago St Louis Kansas City the Twin Cities the whole of the Midwest in short nearlyevery standing thing would be flattened or on fire and nearly every living thing would be dead People up to a thousand miles_away would be knocked off their feet and sliced or clobbered by ablizzard of flying projectiles Beyond a thousand miles the devastation from the blast would graduallydiminish But that's just the initial shockwave No one can do more than guess what the associated damagewould be other than that it would be brisk and global The impact would almost_certainly set_off achain of devastating earthquakes Volcanoes across the globe would begin to rumble and spew Tsunamis would rise up and head devastatingly for distant shores Within an_hour a cloud ofblackness would cover the planet and burning rock and other debris would be pelting downeverywhere setting much of the planet ablaze It has been estimated that at_least a billion and a halfpeople would be dead by the end of the first day The massive disturbances to the ionosphere wouldknock out communications systems everywhere so survivors would have no idea what washappening elsewhere or where to turn It would hardly matter As one commentator has put it fleeingwould mean selecting a slow death over a quick one The death toll would be very little affected byany plausible relocation effort since Earth's ability to support life would be universally diminished The amount of soot and floating ash from the impact and following fires would blot out the sun certainly for months possibly for years disrupting growing cycles In researchers at theCalifornia Institute of Technology analyzed helium isotopes from sediments left from the later KTimpact and concluded that it affected Earth's climate for about ten_thousand years This was actuallyused as evidence to support the notion that the extinction of dinosaurs was swift and emphatic andso it was in geological terms We can only guess how well or whether humanity would cope withsuch an event And in all likelihood remember this would come without warning out of a clear sky But let's assume we did see the object coming What would we do Everyone assumes we wouldsend up a nuclear warhead and blast it to smithereens The idea has some problems however First as John S Lewis notes our missiles are not designed for space work They haven't the oomph toescape Earth's gravity and even if they did there are no mechanisms to guide them across tens ofmillions of miles of space Still less could we send up a shipload of space cowboys to do the job forus as in the movie Armageddon we no_longer possess a rocket powerful enough to send humans evenas far as the Moon The last rocket that could Saturn was retired years_ago and has never beenreplaced Nor could we quickly build a new one because amazingly the plans for Saturn launcherswere destroyed as part of a NASA housecleaning exercise Even if we did manage somehow to get a warhead to the asteroid and blasted it to pieces thechances are that we would simply turn it into a string of rocks that would slam into us one after theother in the manner of Comet Shoemaker Levy on Jupiter but with the difference that now the rockswould be intensely radioactive Tom Gehrels an asteroid hunter at the University of Arizona thinksthat even a year's warning would probably be insufficient to take appropriate action The greaterlikelihood however is that we wouldn't see any object even a comet until it was about six monthsaway which would be much too late Shoemaker Levy had been orbiting Jupiter in a fairlyconspicuous manner since but it took over half a century before anyone noticed Interestingly because these things are so difficult to compute and must incorporate such asignificant margin of error even if we knew an object was heading our way we wouldn't know untilnearly the end the last couple of weeks anyway whether collision was certain For most of thetime of the object's approach we would exist in a kind of cone of uncertainty It would certainly be themost interesting few months in the history of the world And imagine the party if it passed safely So how often does something like the Manson impact happen I_asked Anderson and Witzkebefore leaving Oh about once every million_years on average said Witzke And remember added Anderson this was a relatively minor event Do you know how manyextinctions were associated_with the Manson impact No idea I replied None he said with a strange air of satisfaction Not one Of_course Witzke and Anderson added hastily and more or less in unison there would have beenterrible devastation across much of the Earth as just described and complete annihilation forhundreds of miles around ground zero But life is hardy and when the smoke cleared there wereenough lucky survivors from every species that none permanently perished The good_news it appears is that it takes an awful lot to extinguish a species The bad_news is thatthe good_news can never be counted on Worse still it isn't actually necessary to look to space forpetrifying danger As we are about to see Earth can provide plenty of danger of its own THE FIRE BELOWIN THE SUMMER of a young geologist_named Mike Voorhies was scouting around on somegrassy farmland in eastern Nebraska not far from the little town of Orchard where he had grown up Passing through a steep sided gully he spotted a curious glint in the brush above and clambered up tohave a look What he had seen was the perfectly preserved skull of a young rhinoceros which hadbeen washed out by recent heavy rains A few yards beyond it turned_out was one of the most extraordinary fossil beds ever discoveredin North_America a dried up water hole that had served as a mass grave for scores of animals rhinoceroses zebra like horses saber toothed deer camels turtles All had died from somemysterious cataclysm just under twelve million_years_ago in the time known to geology as theMiocene In those days Nebraska stood on a vast hot plain very like the Serengeti of Africa today The animals had been found buried under volcanic ash up to ten feet deep The puzzle of it was thatthere were not and never had been any volcanoes in Nebraska Today the site of Voorhies's discovery is called Ashfall Fossil Beds State Park and it has astylish new visitors' center and museum with thoughtful displays on the geology of Nebraska and thehistory of the fossil beds The center incorporates a lab with a glass wall through which visitors canwatch paleontologists cleaning bones Working alone in the lab on the morning I passed through was acheerfully grizzled looking fellow in a blue work shirt whom I recognized as Mike Voorhies from aBBC television documentary in which he featured They don't get a huge number of visitors to AshfallFossil Beds State Park it's slightly in the middle of nowhere and Voorhies seemed pleased toshow me around He took me to the spot atop a twenty foot ravine where he had made his find It was a dumb place to look for bones he said happily But I wasn't looking for bones I wasthinking of making a geological map of eastern Nebraska at the time and really just kind of pokingaround If I hadn't gone up this ravine or the rains hadn't just washed out that skull I'd have walked onby and this would never have been found He indicated a roofed enclosure nearby which hadbecome the main excavation site Some two hundred animals had been found lying together in ajumble I_asked_him in what way it was a dumb place to hunt for bones Well if you're looking for bones you really need exposed rock That's_why most paleontology is done in hot dry places It's not thatthere are more bones there It's just that you have some chance of spotting them In a setting likethis he made a sweeping gesture across the vast and unvarying prairie you wouldn't knowwhere to begin There could be really magnificent stuff out there but there's no surface clues to showyou where to start looking At first they thought the animals were buried alive and Voorhies stated as much in a NationalGeographic article in The article called the site a Pompeii of prehistoric animals ' he toldme which was unfortunate because just afterward we realized that the animals hadn't died suddenlyat all They were all suffering from something called hypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy whichis what you would get if you were breathing a lot of abrasive ash and they must have been breathinga lot of it because the ash was feet thick for hundreds of miles He picked up a chunk of grayish claylike dirt and crumbled it into my hand It was powdery but slightly gritty Nasty stuff to have tobreathe he went on because it's very fine but also quite sharp So anyway they came here to thiswatering hole presumably seeking relief and died in some misery The ash would have ruinedeverything It would have buried all the grass and coated every leaf and turned the water into anundrinkable gray sludge It couldn't have been very agreeable at all The BBC documentary had suggested that the existence of so much ash in Nebraska was a surprise In_fact Nebraska's huge ash deposits had been known about for a long time For almost a century theyhad been mined to make household cleaning powders like Comet and Ajax But curiously no one hadever thought to wonder where all the ash came from I'm a little embarrassed to tell you Voorhies said smiling briefly that the first I thought about itwas when an editor at the National_Geographic asked me the source of all the ash and I had toconfess that I didn't know Nobody knew Voorhies sent samples to colleagues all over the western United_States asking if there was anythingabout it that they recognized Several months later a geologist_named Bill Bonnichsen from the IdahoGeological Survey got in touch and told him that the ash matched a volcanic deposit from a placecalled Bruneau Jarbidge in southwest Idaho The event that killed the plains animals of Nebraska wasa volcanic explosion on a scale previously unimagined but big enough to leave an ash layer ten feetdeep almost a thousand miles_away in eastern Nebraska It turned_out that under the western UnitedStates there was a huge cauldron of magma a colossal volcanic hot_spot which eruptedcataclysmically every years or so The last such eruption was just over years_ago The hot_spot is still there These days we call it Yellowstone_National_Park We know amazingly little about what happens beneath our feet It is fairly remarkable to think thatFord has been building cars and baseball has been playing World Series for longer than we haveknown that the Earth has a core And of course the idea that the continents move about on the surfacelike lily pads has been common wisdom for much less than a generation Strange as it may seem wrote Richard_Feynman we understand the distribution of matter in the interior of the Sun far betterthan we understand the interior of the Earth The distance from the surface of Earth to the center is miles which isn't so very far It hasbeen calculated that if you sunk a well to the center and dropped a brick into it it would take onlyforty five minutes for it to hit the bottom though at that point it would be weightless since all theEarth's gravity would be above and around it rather than beneath it Our own attempts to penetratetoward the middle have been modest indeed One or two South African gold mines reach to a depth oftwo miles but most mines on Earth go no more than about a quarter of a mile beneath the surface Ifthe planet were an apple we wouldn't yet have broken through the skin Indeed we haven't even comeclose Until slightly under a century ago what the best informed scientific minds knew about Earth'sinterior was not much more than what a coal miner knew namely that you could dig down throughsoil for a distance and then you'd hit rock and that was about it Then in an Irish geologistnamed R D Oldham while examining some seismograph readings from an earthquake in Guatemala noticed that certain shock waves had penetrated to a point deep within the Earth and then bounced offat an angle as if they had encountered some kind of barrier From this he deduced that the Earth has acore Three years later a Croatian seismologist named Andrija Mohorovi i c was studying graphsfrom an earthquake in Zagreb when he noticed a similar odd deflection but at a shallower level Hehad discovered the boundary between the crust and the layer immediately below the mantle this zonehas been known ever_since as the Mohorovi i c discontinuity or Moho for short We were beginning to get a vague idea of the Earth's layered interior though it really was onlyvague Not_until did a Danish scientist named Inge Lehmann studying seismographs ofearthquakes in New_Zealand discover that there were two cores an inner one that we now believeto be solid and an outer one the one that Oldham had detected that is thought to be liquid and the seatof magnetism At just about the time that Lehmann was refining our basic understanding of the Earth's interior bystudying the seismic waves of earthquakes two geologists at Caltech in California were devising away to make comparisons between one earthquake and the next They were Charles Richter and BenoGutenberg though for reasons that have nothing to do with fairness the scale became known almost atonce as Richter's alone It has nothing to do with Richter either A modest fellow he never referredto the scale by his own name but always called it the Magnitude Scale The Richter scale has always been widely misunderstood by nonscientists though perhaps a littleless so now than in its early days when visitors to Richter's office often asked to see his celebratedscale thinking it was some kind of machine The scale is of course more an idea than an object anarbitrary measure of the Earth's tremblings based on surface measurements It rises exponentially sothat a quake is fifty times more powerful than a earthquake and times more powerfulthan a earthquake At least theoretically there is no upper limit for an earthquake nor come to that a lower limit The scale is a simple measure of force but says nothing about damage A magnitude quakehappening deep in the mantle say four_hundred miles down might cause no surface damage at all while a significantly smaller one happening just four miles under the surface could wreak widespreaddevastation Much too depends on the nature of the subsoil the quake's duration the frequency andseverity of aftershocks and the physical setting of the affected area All this means that the mostfearsome quakes are not necessarily the most forceful though force obviously counts for a lot The largest earthquake since the scale's invention was depending on which source you credit either one centered on Prince William Sound in Alaska in March which measured on theRichter scale or one in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile in which was initially logged at magnitude but later revised upward by some authorities including the United_States GeologicalSurvey to a truly grand scale As you will gather from this measuring earthquakes is not alwaysan exact science particularly when interpreting readings from remote locations At all events bothquakes were whopping The quake not only caused widespread damage across coastal SouthAmerica but also set_off a giant tsunami that rolled six thousand miles across the Pacific and slappedaway much of downtown Hilo Hawaii destroying five hundred buildings and killing sixty people Similar wave surges claimed yet more victims as far away as Japan and the Philippines For pure focused devastation however probably the most intense earthquake in recorded historywas one that struck and essentially shook to pieces Lisbon Portugal on All Saints Day November Just before ten in the morning the city was hit by a sudden sideways lurch nowestimated at magnitude and shaken ferociously for seven full minutes The convulsive force wasso great that the water rushed out of the city's harbor and returned in a wave fifty feet high adding tothe destruction When at last the motion ceased survivors enjoyed just three minutes of calm before asecond shock came only slightly less severe than the first A third and final shock followed two hourslater At the end of it all sixty thousand people were dead and virtually every building for milesreduced to rubble The San Francisco earthquake of for comparison measured an estimated on the Richter scale and lasted less than thirty seconds Earthquakes are fairly common Every_day on average somewhere in the world there are two ofmagnitude or greater that's enough to give anyone nearby a pretty good jolt Although they tendto cluster in certain places notably around the rim of the Pacific they can occur almost anywhere In the United_States only Florida eastern Texas and the upper Midwest seem so far to be almostentirely immune New_England has had two quakes of magnitude or greater in the last two hundredyears In April the region experienced a magnitude shaking in a quake near Lake Champlainon the New_York Vermont border causing extensive local damage and I can attest knockingpictures from walls and children from beds as far away as New_Hampshire The most common types of earthquakes are those where two plates meet as in California along theSan Andreas Fault As the plates push against each other pressures build up until one or the othergives way In general the longer the interval between quakes the greater the pent up pressure andthus the greater the scope for a really big jolt This is a particular worry for Tokyo which BillMcGuire a hazards specialist at University College London describes as the city waiting to die not a motto you will find on many tourism leaflets Tokyo stands on the boundary of three tectonicplates in a country already well known for its seismic instability In as you will remember thecity of Kobe three hundred miles to the west was struck by a magnitude quake which killed people The damage was estimated at billion But that was as nothing well ascomparatively little compared with what may await Tokyo Tokyo has already suffered one of the most devastating earthquakes in modern times On September just before noon the city was hit by what is known as the Great Kanto quake an event morethan ten times more powerful than Kobe's earthquake Two hundred thousand people were killed Since that time Tokyo has been eerily quiet so the strain beneath the surface has been building foreighty years Eventually it is bound to snap In Tokyo had a population of about three million Today it is approaching thirty million Nobody cares to guess how many people might die but thepotential economic cost has been put as high as trillion Even more unnerving because they are less well understood and capable of occurring anywhere atany time are the rarer type of shakings known as intraplate quakes These happen away from plateboundaries which makes them wholly unpredictable And because they come from a much greaterdepth they tend to propagate over much wider areas The most notorious such quakes ever to hit theUnited States were a series of three in New Madrid Missouri in the winter of Theadventure started just after midnight on December when people were awakened first by the noiseof panicking farm animals the restiveness of animals before quakes is not an old wives' tale but is infact well established though not at all understood and then by an almighty rupturing noise from deepwithin the Earth Emerging from their houses locals found the land rolling in waves up to three feethigh and opening up in fissures several feet deep A strong smell of sulfur filled the air The shakinglasted for four minutes with the usual devastating effects to property Among the witnesses was theartist John James Audubon who happened to be in the area The quake radiated outward with suchforce that it knocked down chimneys in Cincinnati four_hundred miles_away and according to at leastone account wrecked boats in East Coast harbors and even collapsed scaffolding erected aroundthe Capitol Building in Washington D C On January and February further quakes of similarmagnitude followed New Madrid has been silent ever_since but not surprisingly since suchepisodes have never been known to happen in the same place twice As far as we know they are asrandom as lightning The next one could be under Chicago or Paris or Kinshasa No one can evenbegin to guess And what causes these massive intraplate rupturings Something deep within theEarth More than that we_don't_know By the s scientists had grown sufficiently frustrated by how little they understood of the Earth'sinterior that they decided to try to do something about it Specifically they got the idea to drill throughthe ocean floor the continental crust was too thick to the Moho discontinuity and to extract a piece ofthe Earth's mantle for examination at leisure The thinking was that if they could understand the natureof the rocks inside the Earth they might begin to understand how they interacted and thus possibly beable to predict earthquakes and other unwelcome events The project became known all but inevitably as the Mohole and it was pretty well disastrous Thehope was to lower a drill through feet of Pacific Ocean water off the coast of Mexico anddrill some feet through relatively thin crustal rock Drilling from a ship in open waters is inthe words of one oceanographer like trying to drill a hole in the sidewalks of New_York from atopthe Empire State Building using a strand of spaghetti Every attempt ended in failure The deepestthey penetrated was only about feet The Mohole became known as the No Hole In exasperated with ever rising costs and no results Congress killed the project Four years later Soviet scientists decided to try their luck on dry land They chose a spot onRussia's Kola Peninsula near the Finnish border and set to work with the hope of drilling to a depthof fifteen kilometers The work proved harder than expected but the Soviets were commendablypersistent When at last they gave up nineteen years later they had drilled to a depth of meters or about miles Bearing in mind that the crust of the Earth represents only about percent of the planet's volume and that the Kola hole had not cut even one third of the way through thecrust we can hardly claim to have conquered the interior Interestingly even though the hole was modest nearly everything about it was surprising Seismicwave studies had led the scientists to predict and pretty confidently that they would encountersedimentary rock to a depth of meters followed by granite for the next meters and basaltfrom there on down In the event the sedimentary layer was percent deeper than expected and thebasaltic layer was never found at all Moreover the world down there was far warmer than anyonehad expected with a temperature at meters of degrees centigrade nearly twice theforecasted level Most surprising of all was that the rock at that depth was saturated with water something that had not been thought possible Because we can't see into the Earth we have to use other techniques which mostly involve readingwaves as they travel through the interior We also know a little bit about the mantle from what areknown as kimberlite pipes where diamonds are formed What happens is that deep in the Earth thereis an explosion that fires in effect a cannonball of magma to the surface at supersonic speeds It is atotally random event A kimberlite pipe could explode in your backyard as you read this Becausethey come up from such depths up to miles down kimberlite pipes bring up all kinds of thingsnot normally found on or near the surface a rock called peridotite crystals of olivine and justoccasionally in about one pipe in a hundred diamonds Lots of carbon comes up with kimberliteejecta but most is vaporized or turns to graphite Only occasionally does a hunk of it shoot up at justthe right speed and cool down with the necessary swiftness to become a diamond It was such a pipethat made Johannesburg the most productive diamond mining city in the world but there may beothers even bigger that we_don't_know about Geologists know that somewhere in the vicinity ofnortheastern Indiana there is evidence of a pipe or group of pipes that may be truly colossal Diamonds up to twenty carats or more have been found at scattered sites throughout the region But noone has ever found the source As John McPhee notes it may be buried under glacially depositedsoil like the Manson crater in Iowa or under the Great Lakes So how much do we know about what's inside the Earth Very little Scientists are generally agreedthat the world beneath us is composed of four layers rocky outer crust a mantle of hot viscousrock a liquid outer core and a solid inner core We know that the surface is dominated bysilicates which are relatively light and not heavy enough to account for the planet's overall density Therefore there must be heavier stuff inside We know that to generate our magnetic_field somewherein the interior there must be a concentrated belt of metallic elements in a liquid state That much isuniversally agreed upon Almost everything beyond that how the layers interact what causes themto behave in the way they do what they will do at any time in the future is a matter of at_least someuncertainty and generally quite a lot of uncertainty Even the one part of it we can see the crust is a matter of some fairly strident debate Nearly allgeology texts tell you that continental crust is three to six miles_thick under the oceans about twentyfive miles_thick under the continents and forty to sixty miles_thick under big mountain chains butthere are many puzzling variabilities within these generalizations The crust beneath the SierraNevada Mountains for_instance is only about nineteen to twenty_five miles_thick and no one knowswhy By all the laws of geophysics the Sierra Nevadas should be sinking as if into quicksand Somepeople think they may be How and when the Earth got its crust are questions that divide geologists into two broad camps those who think it happened abruptly early in the Earth's history and those who think it happenedgradually and rather later Strength of feeling runs deep on such matters Richard Armstrong of Yaleproposed an early burst theory in the s then spent the rest of his career fighting those who didnot agree with him He died of cancer in but shortly before his death he lashed out at hiscritics in a polemic in an Australian earth science journal that charged them with perpetuating myths according to a report in Earth magazine in He died a bitter man reported a colleague The crust and part of the outer mantle together are called the lithosphere from the Greek lithos meaning stone which in turn floats on top of a layer of softer rock called the asthenosphere fromGreek words meaning without strength but such terms are never entirely satisfactory To say thatthe lithosphere floats on top of the asthenosphere suggests a degree of easy buoyancy that isn't quiteright Similarly it is misleading to think of the rocks as flowing in anything like the way we think ofmaterials flowing on the surface The rocks are viscous but only in the same way that glass is It maynot look it but all the glass on Earth is flowing downward under the relentless drag of gravity Remove a pane of really old glass from the window of a European cathedral and it will be noticeablythicker at the bottom than at the top That is the sort of flow we are talking_about The hour hand ona clock moves about ten_thousand times faster than the flowing rocks of the mantle The movements occur not just laterally as the Earth's plates move across the surface but up anddown as well as rocks rise and fall under the churning process known as convection Convection as aprocess was first deduced by the eccentric Count von Rumford at the end of the eighteenth_century Sixty years later an English vicar named Osmond Fisher presciently suggested that the Earth's interiormight well be fluid enough for the contents to move about but that idea took a very long time to gainsupport In about when geophysicists realized just how much turmoil was going on down there itcame as a considerable shock As Shawna Vogel put it in the book Naked Earth The NewGeophysics It was as if scientists had spent decades figuring out the layers of the Earth'satmosphere troposphere stratosphere and so forth and then had suddenly found out about wind How deep the convection process goes has been a matter of controversy ever_since Some say itbegins four_hundred miles down others two thousand miles below us The problem as Donald Trefilhas observed is that there are two sets of data from two different disciplines that cannot bereconciled Geochemists say that certain elements on Earth's surface cannot have come from theupper mantle but must have come from deeper within the Earth Therefore the materials in the upperand lower mantle must at_least occasionally mix Seismologists insist that there is no evidence tosupport such a thesis So all that can be said is that at some slightly indeterminate point as we head toward the center ofEarth we leave the asthenosphere and plunge into pure mantle Considering that it accounts for percent of the Earth's volume and percent of its mass the mantle doesn't attract a great_deal ofattention largely because the things that interest Earth scientists and general readers alike happeneither deeper down as with magnetism or nearer the surface as with earthquakes We know that toa depth of about a hundred miles the mantle consists predominantly of a type of rock known asperidotite but what fills the space beyond is uncertain According to a Nature report it seems not tobe peridotite More than this we do not know Beneath the mantle are the two cores a solid inner core and a liquid outer one Needless to say our_understanding of the nature of these cores is indirect but scientists can make some reasonableassumptions They know that the pressures at the center of the Earth are sufficiently high somethingover three million times those found at the surface to turn any rock there solid They also know fromEarth's history among other clues that the inner core is very good at retaining its heat Although it islittle more than a guess it is thought that in over four billion years the temperature at the core hasfallen by no more than F No one knows exactly how hot the Earth's core is but estimates rangefrom something over F to F about as hot as the surface of the Sun The outer core is in many ways even less well understood though everyone is in agreement that itis fluid and that it is the seat of magnetism The theory was put forward by E C Bullard ofCambridge University in that this fluid part of the Earth's core revolves in a way that makes it in effect an electrical motor creating the Earth's magnetic_field The assumption is that the convectingfluids in the Earth act somehow like the currents in wires Exactly what happens isn't known but it isfelt pretty certain that it is connected with the core spinning and with its being liquid Bodies thatdon't have a liquid core the Moon and Mars for_instance don't have magnetism We know that Earth's magnetic_field changes in power from time to time during the age of thedinosaurs it was up to three times as strong as now We also know that it reverses itself every years or so on average though that average hides a huge degree of unpredictability The lastreversal was about years_ago Sometimes it stays put for millions of years million yearsappears to be the longest stretch and at other times it has reversed after as little as years Altogether in the last million_years it has reversed itself about two hundred times and we don'thave any real idea why It has been called the greatest unanswered question in the geologicalsciences We may be going through a reversal now The Earth's magnetic_field has diminished by perhaps asmuch as percent in the last century alone Any diminution in magnetism is likely to be bad_news because magnetism apart from holding notes to refrigerators and keeping our compasses pointing theright way plays a vital role in keeping us alive Space is full of dangerous cosmic_rays that in theabsence of magnetic protection would tear through our bodies leaving much of our DNA in uselesstatters When the magnetic_field is working these rays are safely herded away from the Earth'ssurface and into two zones in near space called the Van Allen belts They also interact with particlesin the upper atmosphere to create the bewitching veils of light known as the auroras A big part of the reason for our ignorance interestingly enough is that traditionally there has beenlittle effort to coordinate what's happening on top of the Earth with what's going on inside Accordingto Shawna Vogel Geologists and geophysicists rarely go to the same meetings or collaborate on thesame problems Perhaps nothing better demonstrates our inadequate grasp of the dynamics of the Earth's interiorthan how badly we are caught out when it acts up and it would be hard to come up with a moresalutary reminder of the limitations of our_understanding than the eruption of Mount_St Helens inWashington in At that time the lower forty eight United_States had not seen a volcanic eruption for over sixty fiveyears Therefore the government volcanologists called in to monitor and forecast St Helens'sbehavior primarily had seen only Hawaiian volcanoes in action and they it turned_out were not thesame thing at all St_Helens started its ominous rumblings on March Within a week it was erupting magma albeitin modest amounts up to a hundred times a day and being constantly shaken with earthquakes Peoplewere evacuated to what was assumed to be a safe distance of eight miles As the mountain'srumblings grew St_Helens became a tourist attraction for the world Newspapers gave daily reportson the best places to get a view Television crews repeatedly flew in helicopters to the summit andpeople were even seen climbing over the mountain On one day more than seventy copters and lightaircraft circled the summit But as the days passed and the rumblings failed to develop into anythingdramatic people grew restless and the view became general that the volcano wasn't going to blowafter all On April the northern flank of the mountain began to bulge conspicuously Remarkably no onein a position of responsibility saw that this strongly signaled a lateral blast The seismologistsresolutely based their conclusions on the behavior of Hawaiian volcanoes which don't blow outsideways Almost the only person who believed that something really bad might happen was JackHyde a geology professor at a community college in Tacoma He pointed_out that St_Helens didn'thave an open vent as Hawaiian volcanoes have so any pressure building up inside was bound to bereleased dramatically and probably catastrophically However Hyde was not part of the official teamand his observations attracted little notice We all know what happened next At A M on a Sunday morning May the north side of thevolcano collapsed sending an enormous avalanche of dirt and rock rushing down the mountain slopeat miles an_hour It was the biggest landslide in human history and carried enough material tobury the whole of Manhattan to a depth of four_hundred feet A minute later its flank severelyweakened St_Helens exploded with the force of five hundred Hiroshima sized atomic bombs shooting out a murderous hot cloud at up to miles an_hour much too fast clearly for anyonenearby to outrace Many people who were thought to be in safe areas often far out of sight of thevolcano were overtaken Fifty seven people were killed Twenty three of the bodies were neverfound The toll would have been much higher except that it was a Sunday Had it been a weekdaymany lumber workers would have been working within the death zone As it was people were killedeighteen miles_away The luckiest person on that day was a graduate_student named Harry Glicken He had been manningan observation post miles from the mountain but he had a college placement interview on May in California and so had left the site the day before the eruption His place was taken by DavidJohnston Johnston was the first to report the volcano exploding moments later he was dead Hisbody was never found Glicken's luck alas was temporary Eleven years later he was one of fortythree scientists and journalists fatally caught up in a lethal outpouring of superheated ash gases andmolten rock what is known as a pyroclastic flow at Mount Unzen in Japan when yet anothervolcano was catastrophically misread Volcanologists may or may not be the worst scientists in the world at making predictions but theyare without question the worst in the world at realizing how bad their predictions are Less than twoyears after the Unzen catastrophe another group of volcano watchers led by Stanley Williams of theUniversity of Arizona descended into the rim of an active volcano called Galeras in Colombia Despite the deaths of recent years only two of the sixteen members of Williams's party wore safetyhelmets or other protective gear The volcano erupted killing six of the scientists along with threetourists who had followed them and seriously injuring several others including Williams himself In an extraordinarily unself critical book called Surviving Galeras Williams said he could onlyshake my head in wonder when he learned afterward that his colleagues in the world of volcanologyhad suggested that he had overlooked or disregarded important seismic signals and behavedrecklessly How easy it is to snipe after the fact to apply the knowledge we have now to the eventsof he wrote He was guilty of nothing worse he believed than unlucky timing when Galeras behaved capriciously as natural forces are wont to do I was fooled and for that I will takeresponsibility But I do not feel guilty about the deaths of my colleagues There is no guilt There wasonly an eruption But to return to Washington Mount_St Helens lost thirteen hundred feet of peak and squaremiles of forest were devastated Enough trees to build homes or in some reports were blown away The damage was placed at billion A giant column of smoke and ash rose to aheight of sixty thousand feet in less than ten minutes An airliner some thirty miles_away reportedbeing pelted with rocks Ninety minutes after the blast ash began to rain down on Yakima Washington a community of fiftythousand people about eighty miles_away As you would expect the ash turned day to night and gotinto everything clogging motors generators and electrical switching equipment choking pedestrians blocking filtration systems and generally bringing things to a halt The airport shut down andhighways in and out of the city were closed All this was happening you will note just downwind of a volcano that had been rumblingmenacingly for two months Yet Yakima had no volcano emergency procedures The city's emergencybroadcast system which was supposed to swing into action during a crisis did not go on the airbecause the Sunday morning staff did not know how to operate the equipment For three days Yakima was paralyzed and cut off from the world its airport closed its approach roads impassable Altogether the city received just five eighths of an inch of ash after the eruption of Mount_St Helens Now bear that in mind please as we consider what a Yellowstone blast would do DANGEROUS BEAUTYIN THE s while studying the volcanic history of Yellowstone_National_Park Bob Christiansenof the United_States Geological Survey became puzzled about something that oddly had not troubledanyone before he couldn't find the park's volcano It had been known for a long time that Yellowstonewas volcanic in nature that's what accounted for all its geysers and other steamy features and theone thing about volcanoes is that they are generally pretty conspicuous But Christiansen couldn't findthe Yellowstone volcano anywhere In particular what he couldn't find was a structure known as acaldera Most of us when we think of volcanoes think of the classic cone shapes of a Fuji or Kilimanjaro which are created when erupting magma accumulates in a symmetrical mound These can formremarkably quickly In at Par cutin in Mexico a farmer was startled to see smoke rising from apatch on his land In one week he was the bemused owner of a cone five hundred feet high Withintwo years it had topped out at almost fourteen hundred feet and was more than half a mile across Altogether there are some ten_thousand of these intrusively visible volcanoes on Earth all but a fewhundred of them extinct But there is a second less celebrated type of volcano that doesn't involvemountain building These are volcanoes so explosive that they burst open in a single mighty rupture leaving behind a vast subsided pit the caldera from a Latin word for cauldron Yellowstoneobviously was of this second type but Christiansen couldn't find the caldera anywhere By coincidence just at this time NASA decided to test some new high altitude cameras by takingphotographs of Yellowstone copies of which some thoughtful official passed on to the parkauthorities on the assumption that they might make a nice blow up for one of the visitors' centers Assoon as Christiansen saw the photos he realized why he had failed to spot the caldera virtually thewhole park million acres was caldera The explosion had left a crater more than forty milesacross much too huge to be perceived from anywhere at ground level At some time in the pastYellowstone must have blown up with a violence far beyond the scale of anything known to humans Yellowstone it turns_out is a supervolcano It sits on top of an enormous hot_spot a reservoir ofmolten rock that rises from at_least miles down in the Earth The heat from the hot_spot is whatpowers all of Yellowstone's vents geysers hot springs and popping mud pots Beneath the surface isa magma chamber that is about forty five miles across roughly the same dimensions as the park and about eight miles_thick at its thickest point Imagine a pile of TNT about the size of Rhode Islandand reaching eight miles into the sky to about the height of the highest cirrus clouds and you havesome idea of what visitors to Yellowstone are shuffling around on top of The pressure that such apool of magma exerts on the crust above has lifted Yellowstone and about three hundred miles ofsurrounding territory about feet higher than they would otherwise be If it blew the cataclysm ispretty well beyond imagining According to Professor Bill McGuire of University College London you wouldn't be able to get within a thousand kilometers of it while it was erupting Theconsequences that followed would be even worse Superplumes of the type on which Yellowstone sits are rather like martini glasses thin on the wayup but spreading out as they near the surface to create vast bowls of unstable magma Some of thesebowls can be up to miles across According to theories they don't always erupt explosively butsometimes burst forth in a vast continuous outpouring a flood of molten rock such as with theDeccan Traps in India sixty five million_years_ago Trap in this context comes from a Swedish wordfor a type of lava Deccan is simply an area These covered an area of square miles andprobably contributed to the demise of the dinosaurs they certainly didn't help with their noxiousoutgassings Superplumes may also be responsible for the rifts that cause continents to break up Such plumes are not all that rare There are about thirty active ones on the Earth at the moment andthey are responsible for many of the world's best known islands and island chains Iceland Hawaii the Azores Canaries and Gal pagos archipelagos little Pitcairn in the middle of the South Pacific and many others but apart from Yellowstone they are all oceanic No one has the faintest idea howor why Yellowstone's ended_up beneath a continental plate Only two things are certain that the crustat Yellowstone is thin and that the world beneath it is hot But whether the crust is thin because of thehot spot or whether the hot_spot is there because the crust is thin is a matter of heated as it were debate The continental nature of the crust makes a huge difference to its eruptions Where the othersupervolcanoes tend to bubble away steadily and in a comparatively benign fashion Yellowstoneblows explosively It doesn't happen often but when it does you want to stand well back Since its first known eruption million_years_ago it has blown up about a hundred times butthe most recent three eruptions are the ones that get written about The last eruption was a thousandtimes greater than that of Mount_St Helens the one before that was times bigger and the onebefore was so big that nobody knows exactly how big it was It was at_least twenty_five hundredtimes greater than St_Helens but perhaps eight thousand times more monstrous We have absolutely nothing to compare it to The biggest blast in recent times was that of Krakatauin Indonesia in August which made a bang that reverberated around the world for nine days and made water slosh as far away as the English Channel But if you imagine the volume of ejectedmaterial from Krakatau as being about the size of a golf ball then the biggest of the Yellowstoneblasts would be the size of a sphere you could just about hide behind On this scale Mount_St Helens's would be no more than a pea The Yellowstone eruption of two million_years_ago put out enough ash to bury New_York State to adepth of sixty seven feet or California to a depth of twenty This was the ash that made MikeVoorhies's fossil beds in eastern Nebraska That blast occurred in what is now Idaho but overmillions of years at a rate of about one inch a year the Earth's_crust has traveled over it so that todayit is directly under northwest Wyoming The hot_spot itself stays in one place like an acetylene torchaimed at a ceiling In its wake it leaves the sort of rich volcanic plains that are ideal for growingpotatoes as Idaho's farmers long ago discovered In another two million_years geologists like tojoke Yellowstone will be producing French fries for McDonald's and the people of Billings Montana will be stepping around geysers The ash fall from the last Yellowstone eruption covered all or parts of nineteen western states plus parts of Canada and Mexico nearly the whole of the United_States west of the Mississippi This bear in mind is the breadbasket of America an area that produces roughly half the world'scereals And ash it is worth remembering is not like a big snowfall that will melt in the spring If youwanted to grow crops again you would have to find some place to put all the ash It took thousands ofworkers eight months to clear billion_tons of debris from the sixteen acres of the World TradeCenter site in New_York Imagine what it would take to clear Kansas And that's not even to consider the climatic consequences The last supervolcano eruption on Earthwas at Toba in northern Sumatra seventy four thousand years_ago No one knows quite how big itwas other than that it was a whopper Greenland ice cores show that the Toba blast was followed byat least six years of volcanic winter and goodness knows how many poor growing seasons afterthat The event it is thought may have carried humans right to the brink of extinction reducing theglobal population to no more than a few thousand individuals That means that all modern humansarose from a very small population base which would explain our lack of genetic diversity At allevents there is some evidence to suggest that for the next twenty thousand years the total number ofpeople on Earth was never more than a few thousand at any time That is needless to say a long timeto recover from a single volcanic blast All this was hypothetically interesting until when an odd occurrence made it suddenlymomentous water in Yellowstone Lake in the heart of the park began to run over the banks at thelake's southern end flooding a meadow while at the opposite end of the lake the water mysteriouslyflowed away Geologists did a hasty survey and discovered that a large area of the park haddeveloped an ominous bulge This was lifting up one end of the lake and causing the water to run outat the other as would happen if you lifted one side of a child's wading pool By the wholecentral region of the park several dozen square miles was more than three feet higher than it hadbeen in when the park was last formally surveyed Then in the whole of the central partof the park subsided by eight inches It now seems to be swelling again The geologists realized that only one thing could cause this a restless magma chamber Yellowstone wasn't the site of an ancient supervolcano it was the site of an active one It was also atabout this time that they were able to work out that the cycle of Yellowstone's eruptions averaged onemassive blow every years The last one interestingly enough was years_ago Yellowstone it appears is due It may not feel like it but you're standing on the largest active volcano in the world Paul Doss Yellowstone_National_Park geologist told_me soon_after climbing off an enormous Harley Davidsonmotorcycle and shaking hands when we met at the park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs earlyon a lovely morning in June A native of Indiana Doss is an amiable soft spoken extremelythoughtful man who looks nothing like a National_Park Service employee He has a graying beard andhair tied back in a long ponytail A small sapphire stud graces one ear A slight paunch strains againsthis crisp Park Service uniform He looks more like a blues musician than a government employee Infact he is a blues musician harmonica But he sure knows and loves geology And I've got the bestplace in the world to do it he says as we set_off in a bouncy battered four wheel drive vehicle inthe general direction of Old Faithful He has agreed to let me accompany him for a day as he goesabout doing whatever it is a park geologist does The first assignment today is to give an introductorytalk to a new crop of tour guides Yellowstone I hardly need point out is sensationally beautiful with plump stately mountains bison specked meadows tumbling streams a sky blue lake wildlife beyond counting It reallydoesn't get any better than this if you're a geologist Doss says You've got rocks up at BeartoothGap that are nearly three billion years_old three quarters of the way back to Earth's beginning andthen you've got mineral springs here he points at the sulfurous hot springs from which Mammothtakes its title where you can see rocks as they are being born And in between there's everythingyou could possibly imagine I've never been any place where geology is more evident or prettier So you like it I say Oh no I love it he answers with profound sincerity I mean I really love it here The wintersare tough and the pay's not too hot but when it's good it's just He interrupted himself to point out a distant gap in a range of mountains to the west which had justcome into view over a rise The mountains he told_me were known as the Gallatins That gap issixty or maybe seventy miles across For a long time nobody could understand why that gap wasthere and then Bob Christiansen realized that it had to be because the mountains were just blownaway When you've got sixty miles of mountains just obliterated you know you're dealing withsomething pretty potent It took Christiansen six years to figure it all out I_asked_him what caused Yellowstone to blow when it did Don't know Nobody knows Volcanoes are strange things We really don't understand them at all Vesuvius in Italy was active for three hundred years until an eruption in and then it juststopped It's been silent ever_since Some volcanologists think that it is recharging in a big way which is a little worrying because two million people live on or around it But nobody knows And how much warning would you get if Yellowstone was going to go He shrugged Nobody was around the last time it blew so nobody knows what the warning signsare Probably you would have swarms of earthquakes and some surface uplift and possibly somechanges in the patterns of behavior of the geysers and steam vents but nobody really knows So it could just blow without warning He nodded thoughtfully The trouble he explained is that nearly all the things that would constitutewarning signs already exist in some measure at Yellowstone Earthquakes are generally a precursorof volcanic eruptions but the park already has lots of earthquakes of them last year Most ofthem are too small to be felt but they are earthquakes nonetheless A change in the pattern of geyser eruptions might also be taken as a clue he said but these too varyunpredictably Once the most famous geyser in the park was Excelsior Geyser It used to eruptregularly and spectacularly to heights of three hundred feet but in it just stopped Then in it erupted again though only to a height of eighty feet Steamboat Geyser is the biggest geyser in theworld when it blows shooting water four_hundred feet into the air but the intervals between itseruptions have ranged from as little as four days to almost fifty years If it blew today and again nextweek that wouldn't tell us anything at all about what it might do the following week or the week afteror twenty years from now Doss says The whole park is so volatile that it's essentially impossibleto draw conclusions from almost anything that happens Evacuating Yellowstone would never be easy The park gets some three million visitors a year mostly in the three peak months of summer The park's roads are comparatively few and they are keptintentionally narrow partly to slow traffic partly to preserve an air of picturesqueness and partlybecause of topographical constraints At the height of summer it can easily take half a day to cross thepark and hours to get anywhere within it Whenever people see animals they just stop whereverthey are Doss says We get bear jams We get bison jams We get wolf jams In the autumn of representatives from the U_S Geological Survey and National_Park Service along with some academics met and formed something called the Yellowstone VolcanicObservatory Four such bodies were in existence already in Hawaii California Alaska andWashington but oddly none in the largest volcanic zone in the world The YVO is not actually athing but more an idea an agreement to coordinate efforts at studying and analyzing the park'sdiverse geology One of their first tasks Doss told_me was to draw up an earthquake and volcanohazards plan a plan of action in the event of a crisis There isn't one already I said No Afraid not But there will be soon Isn't that just a little tardy He smiled Well let's just say that it's not any too soon Once it is in place the idea is that three people Christiansen in Menlo Park California ProfessorRobert B Smith at the University of Utah and Doss in the park would assess the degree of dangerof any potential cataclysm and advise the park superintendent The superintendent would take thedecision whether to evacuate the park As for surrounding areas there are no plans If Yellowstonewere going to blow in a really big way you would be on your own once you left the park gates Of_course it may be tens of thousands of years before that day comes Doss thinks such a day maynot come at all Just because there was a pattern in the past doesn't mean that it still holds true hesays There is some evidence to suggest that the pattern may be a series of catastrophic explosions then a long period of quiet We may be in that now The evidence now is that most of the magmachamber is cooling and crystallizing It is releasing its volatiles you need to trap volatiles for anexplosive eruption In the meantime there are plenty of other dangers in and around Yellowstone as was madedevastatingly evident on the night of August at a place called Hebgen Lake just outside thepark At twenty minutes to midnight on that date Hebgen Lake suffered a catastrophic quake It wasmagnitude not vast as earthquakes go but so abrupt and wrenching that it collapsed an entiremountainside It was the height of the summer season though fortunately not so many people went toYellowstone in those days as now Eighty million tons of rock moving at more than one hundredmiles an_hour just fell off the mountain traveling with such force and momentum that the leading edgeof the landslide ran four_hundred feet up a mountain on the other side of the valley Along its path laypart of the Rock Creek Campground Twenty eight campers were killed nineteen of them buried toodeep ever to be found again The devastation was swift but heartbreakingly fickle Three brothers sleeping in one tent were spared Their parents sleeping in another tent beside them were sweptaway and never seen again A big earthquake and I mean big will happen sometime Doss told_me You can count onthat This is a big fault zone for earthquakes Despite the Hebgen Lake quake and the other known risks Yellowstone didn't get permanentseismometers until the s If you needed a way to appreciate the grandeur and inexorable nature of geologic processes youcould do worse than to consider the Tetons the sumptuously jagged range that stands just to the southof Yellowstone_National_Park Nine million_years_ago the Tetons didn't exist The land aroundJackson Hole was just a high grassy plain But then a forty mile long fault opened within the Earth and since then about once every nine hundred years the Tetons experience a really big earthquake enough to jerk them another six feet higher It is these repeated jerks over eons that have raised themto their present majestic heights of seven thousand feet That nine hundred years is an average and a somewhat misleading one According to Robert B Smith and Lee J Siegel in Windows into the Earth a geological history of the region the last majorTeton quake was somewhere between about five and seven thousand years_ago The Tetons in short are about the most overdue earthquake zone on the planet Hydrothermal explosions are also a significant risk They can happen anytime pretty muchanywhere and without any predictability You know by design we funnel visitors into thermalbasins Doss told_me after we had watched Old Faithful blow It's what they come to see Did youknow there are more geysers and hot springs at Yellowstone than in all the rest of the worldcombined I didn't know that He nodded Ten thousand of them and nobody knows when a new vent might open We drove toa place called Duck Lake a body of water a couple of hundred yards across It looks completelyinnocuous he said It's just a big pond But this big hole didn't used to be here At some time in thelast fifteen thousand years this blew in a really big way You'd have had several tens of millions oftons of earth and rock and superheated water blowing out at hypersonic speeds You can imaginewhat it would be like if this happened under say the parking lot at Old Faithful or one of the visitors'centers He made an unhappy face Would there be any warning Probably not The last significant explosion in the park was at a place called Pork Chop Geyser in That left a crater about five meters across not huge by any means but big enough if youhappened to be standing there at the time Fortunately nobody was around so nobody was hurt butthat happened without warning In the very ancient past there have been explosions that have madeholes a mile across And nobody can tell you where or when that might happen again You just haveto hope that you're not standing there when it does Big rockfalls are also a danger There was a big one at Gardiner Canyon in but againfortunately no one was hurt Late in the afternoon Doss and I stopped at a place where there was arock overhang poised above a busy park road Cracks were clearly visible It could go at any time Doss said thoughtfully You're kidding I said There wasn't a moment when there weren't two cars passing beneath it allfilled with in the most literal sense happy campers Oh it's not likely he added I'm just saying it could Equally it could stay like that for decades There's just no telling People have to accept that there is risk in coming here That's all there is to it As we walked back to his vehicle to head back to Mammoth Hot Springs Doss added But thething is most of the time bad things don't happen Rocks don't fall Earthquakes don't occur Newvents don't suddenly open up For all the instability it's mostly remarkably and amazingly tranquil Like Earth itself I remarked Precisely he agreed The risks at Yellowstone apply to park employees as much as to visitors Doss got a horrific sense ofthat in his first week on the job five years earlier Late one night three young summer employeesengaged in an illicit activity known as hot potting swimming or basking in warm pools Thoughthe park for obvious reasons doesn't publicize it not all the pools in Yellowstone are dangerouslyhot Some are extremely agreeable to lie in and it was the habit of some of the summer employees tohave a dip late at night even though it was against the rules to do so Foolishly the threesome hadfailed to take a flashlight which was extremely dangerous because much of the soil around the warmpools is crusty and thin and one can easily fall through into a scalding vent below In any case as theymade their way back to their dorm they came across a stream that they had had to leap over earlier They backed up a few paces linked arms and on the count of three took a running jump In_fact itwasn't the stream at all It was a boiling pool In the dark they had lost their bearings None of thethree survived I thought about this the next morning as I made a brief call on my way out of the park at a placecalled Emerald Pool in the Upper Geyser Basin Doss hadn't had time to take me there the daybefore but I thought I ought at_least to have a look at it for Emerald Pool is a historic site In a husband and wife team of biologists named Thomas and Louise Brock while on asummer study trip had done a crazy thing They had scooped up some of the yellowy brown scum thatrimmed the pool and examined it for life To their and eventually the wider world's deep surprise itwas full of living microbes They had found the world's first extremophiles organisms that couldlive in water that had previously been assumed to be much too hot or acid or choked with sulfur tobear life Emerald Pool remarkably was all these things yet at_least two types of living_things Sulpholobus acidocaldarius and Thermophilus aquaticus as they became known found it congenial It had always been supposed that nothing could survive above temperatures of C F but herewere organisms basking in rank acidic waters nearly twice that hot For almost twenty years one of the Brocks' two new bacteria Thermophilus aquaticus remaineda laboratory curiosity until a scientist in California named Kary B Mullis realized that heat resistantenzymes within it could be used to create a bit of chemical wizardry known as a polymerase chainreaction which allows scientists to generate lots of DNA from very small amounts as little as asingle molecule in ideal conditions It's a kind of genetic photocopying and it became the basis for allsubsequent genetic science from academic studies to police forensic work It won Mullis the NobelPrize in chemistry in Meanwhile scientists were finding even hardier microbes now known as hyperthermophiles which demand temperatures of C F or more The warmest organism found so far accordingto Frances Ashcroft in Life at the Extremes is Pyrolobus fumarii which dwells in the walls ofocean vents where the temperature can reach C F The upper limit for life is thought tobe about C F though no one actually knows At all events the Brocks' findings completelychanged our perception of the living world As NASA scientist Jay Bergstralh has put it Whereverwe go on Earth even into what's seemed like the most hostile possible environments for life aslong as there is liquid water and some source of chemical energy we find life Life it turns_out is infinitely more clever and adaptable than anyone had ever supposed This is avery good thing for as we are about to see we live in a world that doesn't altogether seem to want ushere PART V LIFE ITSELF LONELY PLANETIT ISN'T EASY being an organism In the whole universe as far as we yet know there is only oneplace an inconspicuous outpost of the Milky_Way called Earth that will sustain you and even it canbe pretty grudging From the bottom of the deepest ocean trench to the top of the highest mountain the zone that coversnearly the whole of known life is only something over a dozen miles not much when set against theroominess of the cosmos at large For humans it is even worse because we happen to belong to the portion of living_things that tookthe rash but venturesome decision million_years_ago to crawl out of the seas and become landbased and oxygen breathing In consequence no less than percent of the world's habitable spaceby volume according to one estimate is fundamentally in practical terms completely off limits tous It isn't simply that we can't breathe in water but that we couldn't bear the pressures Because wateris about times heavier than air pressures rise swiftly as you descend by the equivalent of oneatmosphere for every ten meters thirty three feet of depth On land if you rose to the top of a fivehundred foot eminence Cologne Cathedral or the Washington Monument say the change inpressure would be so slight as to be indiscernible At the same depth underwater however yourveins would collapse and your lungs would compress to the approximate dimensions of a Coke can Amazingly people do voluntarily dive to such depths without breathing apparatus for the fun of it ina sport known as free diving Apparently the experience of having your internal organs rudelydeformed is thought exhilarating though not presumably as exhilarating as having them return to theirformer dimensions upon resurfacing To reach such depths however divers must be dragged down and quite briskly by weights Without assistance the deepest anyone has gone and lived to talk aboutit afterward was an Italian named Umberto Pelizzari who in dove to a depth of feet lingered for a nanosecond and then shot back to the surface In terrestrial terms feet is justslightly over the length of one New_York City block So even in our most exuberant stunts we canhardly claim to be masters of the abyss Other organisms do of course manage to deal with the pressures at depth though quite how some ofthem do so is a mystery The deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench in the Pacific There some seven miles down the pressures rise to over sixteen thousand pounds per square inch We havemanaged once briefly to send humans to that depth in a sturdy diving vessel yet it is home tocolonies of amphipods a type of crustacean similar to shrimp but transparent which survive withoutany protection at all Most oceans are of course much shallower but even at the average ocean depthof two and a half miles the pressure is equivalent to being squashed beneath a stack of fourteenloaded cement trucks Nearly everyone including the authors of some popular books on oceanography assumes that thehuman body would crumple under the immense pressures of the deep ocean In_fact this appears notto be the case Because we are made largely of water ourselves and water is virtuallyincompressible in the words of Frances Ashcroft of Oxford_University the body remains at thesame pressure as the surrounding water and is not crushed at depth It is the gases inside your_body particularly in the lungs that cause the trouble These do compress though at what point thecompression becomes fatal is not known Until quite recently it was thought that anyone diving to onehundred meters or so would die painfully as his or her lungs imploded or chest wall collapsed butthe free divers have repeatedly proved otherwise It appears according to Ashcroft that humansmay be more like whales and dolphins than had been expected Plenty else can go wrong however In the days of diving suits the sort that were connected to thesurface by long hoses divers sometimes experienced a dreaded phenomenon known as thesqueeze This occurred when the surface pumps failed leading to a catastrophic loss of pressure inthe suit The air would leave the suit with such violence that the hapless diver would be all tooliterally sucked up into the helmet and hosepipe When hauled to the surface all that is left in thesuit are his bones and some rags of flesh the biologist J_B S Haldane wrote in adding for thebenefit of doubters This has happened Incidentally the original diving helmet designed in by an Englishman named Charles Deane was intended not for diving but for fire fighting It was called a smoke helmet but being made ofmetal it was hot and cumbersome and as Deane soon discovered firefighters had no particulareagerness to enter burning structures in any form of attire but most especially not in something thatheated up like a kettle and made them clumsy into the bargain In an attempt to save his investment Deane tried it underwater and found it was ideal for salvage work The real terror of the deep however is the bends not so much because they are unpleasant though of course they are as because they are so much more likely The air we breathe is percentnitrogen Put the human_body under pressure and that nitrogen is transformed into tiny bubbles thatmigrate into the blood and tissues If the pressure is changed too rapidly as with a too quick ascentby a diver the bubbles trapped within the body will begin to fizz in exactly the manner of a freshlyopened bottle of champagne clogging tiny blood vessels depriving cells of oxygen and causing painso excruciating that sufferers are prone to bend double in agony hence the bends The bends have been an occupational hazard for sponge and pearl divers since time immemorialbut didn't attract much attention in the Western world until the nineteenth_century and then it wasamong people who didn't get wet at all or at_least not very wet and not generally much above theankles They were caisson workers Caissons were enclosed dry chambers built on riverbeds tofacilitate the construction of bridge piers They were filled with compressed air and often when theworkers emerged after an extended period of working under this artificial pressure they experiencedmild symptoms like tingling or itchy skin But an unpredictable few felt more insistent pain in thejoints and occasionally collapsed in agony sometimes never to get up again It was all most puzzling Sometimes workers would go to bed feeling fine but wake up paralyzed Sometimes they wouldn't wake up at all Ashcroft relates a story concerning the directors of a newtunnel under the Thames who held a celebratory banquet as the tunnel neared completion To theirconsternation their champagne failed to fizz when uncorked in the compressed air of the tunnel However when at length they emerged into the fresh air of a London evening the bubbles spranginstantly to fizziness memorably enlivening the digestive process Apart from avoiding high pressure environments altogether only two strategies are reliablysuccessful against the bends The first is to suffer only a very short exposure to the changes inpressure That is why the free divers I mentioned earlier can descend to depths of five hundred feetwithout ill effect They don't stay under long enough for the nitrogen in their system to dissolve intotheir tissues The other solution is to ascend by careful stages This allows the little bubbles ofnitrogen to dissipate harmlessly A great_deal of what we know about surviving at extremes is owed to the extraordinary father andson team of John Scott and J_B S Haldane Even by the demanding standards of British intellectuals the Haldanes were outstandingly eccentric The senior Haldane was born in to an aristocraticScottish family his brother was Viscount Haldane but spent most of his career in comparativemodesty as a professor of physiology at Oxford He was famously absent minded Once after his wifehad sent him upstairs to change for a dinner party he failed to return and was discovered asleep inbed in his pajamas When roused Haldane explained that he had found himself disrobing andassumed it was bedtime His idea of a vacation was to travel to Cornwall to study hookworm inminers Aldous Huxley the novelist grandson of T_H_Huxley who lived with the Haldanes for atime parodied him a touch mercilessly as the scientist Edward Tantamount in the novel PointCounter Point Haldane's gift to diving was to work out the rest intervals necessary to manage an ascent from thedepths without getting the bends but his interests ranged across the whole of physiology fromstudying altitude sickness in climbers to the problems of heatstroke in desert regions He had aparticular interest in the effects of toxic gases on the human_body To understand more exactly howcarbon monoxide leaks killed miners he methodically poisoned himself carefully taking andmeasuring his own blood samples the while He quit only when he was on the verge of losing allmuscle control and his blood saturation level had reached percent a level as Trevor Nortonnotes in his entertaining history of diving Stars Beneath the Sea only fractionally removed fromnearly certain lethality Haldane's son Jack known to posterity as J_B S was a remarkable prodigy who took an interest inhis father's work almost from infancy At the age of three he was overheard demanding peevishly ofhis father But is it oxyhaemoglobin or carboxyhaemoglobin Throughout his youth the youngHaldane helped his father with experiments By the time he was a teenager the two often tested gasesand gas masks together taking turns to see how long it took them to pass out Though J_B S Haldane never took a degree in science he studied classics at Oxford he becamea brilliant scientist in his own right mostly in Cambridge The biologist Peter Medawar who spenthis life around mental Olympians called him the cleverest man I ever knew Huxley likewiseparodied the younger Haldane in his novel Antic Hay but also used his ideas on genetic manipulationof humans as the basis for the plot of Brave New World Among many other achievements Haldaneplayed a central role in marrying Darwinian principles of evolution to the genetic work of GregorMendel to produce what is known to geneticists as the Modern Synthesis Perhaps uniquely among human_beings the younger Haldane found World_War I a very enjoyableexperience and freely admitted that he enjoyed the opportunity of killing people He was himselfwounded twice After the war he became a successful popularizer of science and wrote twenty threebooks as well as over four_hundred scientific papers His books are still thoroughly readable andinstructive though not always easy to find He also became an enthusiastic Marxist It has beensuggested not altogether cynically that this was out of a purely contrarian instinct and that if he hadbeen born in the Soviet Union he would have been a passionate monarchist At all events most of hisarticles first appeared in the Communist Daily Worker Whereas his father's principal interests concerned miners and poisoning the younger Haldanebecame obsessed with saving submariners and divers from the unpleasant consequences of theirwork With Admiralty funding he acquired a decompression chamber that he called the pressurepot This was a metal cylinder into which three people at a time could be sealed and subjected totests of various types all painful and nearly all dangerous Volunteers might be required to sit in icewater while breathing aberrant atmosphere or subjected to rapid changes of pressurization In oneexperiment Haldane simulated a dangerously hasty ascent to see what would happen What happenedwas that the dental fillings in his teeth exploded Almost every experiment Norton writes endedwith someone having a seizure bleeding or vomiting The chamber was virtually soundproof so theonly way for occupants to signal unhappiness or distress was to tap insistently on the chamber wall orto hold up notes to a small window On another occasion while poisoning himself with elevated levels of oxygen Haldane had a fit sosevere that he crushed several vertebrae Collapsed lungs were a routine hazard Perforated eardrumswere quite common but as Haldane reassuringly noted in one of his essays the drum generallyheals up and if a hole remains in it although one is somewhat deaf one can blow tobacco smoke outof the ear in question which is a social accomplishment What was extraordinary about this was not that Haldane was willing to subject himself to such riskand discomfort in the pursuit of science but that he had no trouble talking colleagues and loved onesinto climbing into the chamber too Sent on a simulated descent his wife once had a fit that lastedthirteen minutes When at last she stopped bouncing across the floor she was helped to her feet andsent home to cook dinner Haldane happily employed whoever happened to be around including onone memorable occasion a former prime minister of Spain Juan Negr n Dr Negr n complainedafterward of minor tingling and a curious velvety sensation on the lips but otherwise seems to haveescaped unharmed He may have considered himself very lucky A similar experiment with oxygendeprivation left Haldane without feeling in his buttocks and lower spine for six years Among Haldane's many specific preoccupations was nitrogen intoxication For reasons that arestill poorly understood beneath depths of about a hundred feet nitrogen becomes a powerfulintoxicant Under its influence divers had been known to offer their air hoses to passing fish or decideto try to have a smoke break It also produced wild mood swings In one test Haldane noted thesubject alternated between depression and elation at one moment begging to be decompressedbecause he felt bloody awful' and the next minute laughing and attempting to interfere with hiscolleague's dexterity test In order to measure the rate of deterioration in the subject a scientist hadto go into the chamber with the volunteer to conduct simple mathematical tests But after a fewminutes as Haldane later recalled the tester was usually as intoxicated as the testee and oftenforgot to press the spindle of his stopwatch or to take proper notes The cause of the inebriation iseven now a mystery It is thought that it may be the same thing that causes alcohol intoxication but asno one knows for certain what causes that we are none the wiser At all events without the greatestcare it is easy to get in trouble once you leave the surface world Which brings us back well nearly to our earlier observation that Earth is not the easiest place to bean organism even if it is the only place Of the small portion of the planet's surface that is dry enoughto stand on a surprisingly large amount is too hot or cold or dry or steep or lofty to be of much use tous Partly it must be conceded this is our fault In terms of adaptability humans are pretty amazinglyuseless Like most animals we don't much like really hot places but because we sweat so freely andeasily stroke we are especially vulnerable In the worst circumstances on foot without water in ahot desert most people will grow delirious and keel over possibly never to rise again in no morethan six or seven hours We are no less helpless in the face of cold Like all mammals humans aregood at generating heat but because we are so nearly hairless not good at keeping it Even in quitemild weather half the calories you burn go to keep your_body warm Of_course we can counter thesefrailties to a large extent by employing clothing and shelter but even so the portions of Earth onwhich we are prepared or able to live are modest indeed just percent of the total land area andonly percent of the whole surface if you include the seas Yet when you consider conditions elsewhere in the known universe the wonder is not that we useso little of our planet but that we have managed to find a planet that we can use even a bit of Youhave only to look at our_own solar_system or come to that Earth at certain periods in its ownhistory to appreciate that most places are much harsher and much less amenable to life than ourmild blue watery globe So far space scientists have discovered about seventy planets outside the solar_system out of theten billion trillion or so that are thought to be out there so humans can hardly claim to speak withauthority on the matter but it appears that if you wish to have a planet suitable for life you have to bejust awfully lucky and the more advanced the life the luckier you have to be Various observers haveidentified about two dozen particularly helpful breaks we have had on Earth but this is a flyingsurvey so we'll distill them down to the principal four They are Excellent location We are to an almost uncanny degree the right distance from the right sort ofstar one that is big enough to radiate lots of energy but not so big as to burn itself out swiftly It is acuriosity of physics that the larger a star the more rapidly it burns Had our sun been ten times asmassive it would have exhausted itself after ten million_years instead of ten billion and we wouldn'tbe here now We are also fortunate to orbit where we do Too much nearer and everything on Earthwould have boiled away Much farther away and everything would have frozen In an astrophysicist named Michael Hart made some calculations and concluded that Earthwould have been uninhabitable had it been just percent farther from or percent closer to the Sun That's not much and in fact it wasn't enough The figures have since been refined and made a littlemore generous percent nearer and percent farther are thought to be more accurate assessmentsfor our zone of habitability but that is still a narrow belt To appreciate just how narrow you have only to look at Venus Venus is only twenty_five millionmiles closer to the Sun than we are The Sun's warmth reaches it just two minutes before it touches us In size and composition Venus is very like Earth but the small difference in orbital distance made allthe difference to how it turned_out It appears that during the early years of the solar_system Venuswas only slightly warmer than Earth and probably had oceans But those few degrees of extra warmthmeant that Venus could not hold on to its surface water with disastrous consequences for its climate As its water evaporated the hydrogen atoms escaped into space and the oxygen atoms combined withcarbon to form a dense atmosphere of the greenhouse gas CO Venus became stifling Althoughpeople of my age will recall a time when astronomers hoped that Venus might harbor life beneath itspadded clouds possibly even a kind of tropical verdure we now know that it is much too fierce anenvironment for any kind of life that we can reasonably conceive of Its surface temperature is aroasting degrees centigrade roughly degrees_Fahrenheit which is hot enough to melt lead and the atmospheric pressure at the surface is ninety times that of Earth or more than any human bodycould withstand We lack the technology to make suits or even spaceships that would allow us tovisit Our knowledge of Venus's surface is based on distant radar imagery and some startled squawksfrom an unmanned Soviet probe that was dropped hopefully into the clouds in and functioned forbarely an_hour before permanently shutting down So that's what happens when you move two light minutes closer to the Sun Travel farther out andthe problem becomes not heat but cold as Mars frigidly attests It too was once a much morecongenial place but couldn't retain a usable atmosphere and turned into a frozen waste But just being the right distance from the Sun cannot be the whole story for otherwise the Moonwould be forested and fair which patently it is not For that you need to have The right kind of planet I don't imagine even many geophysicists when asked to count theirblessings would include living on a planet with a molten interior but it's a pretty near certainty thatwithout all that magma swirling around beneath us we wouldn't be here now Apart from much else our lively interior created the outgassing that helped to build an atmosphere and provided us with themagnetic field that shields us from cosmic radiation It also gave us plate_tectonics which continuallyrenews and rumples the surface If Earth were perfectly smooth it would be covered everywherewith water to a depth of four kilometers There might be life in that lonesome ocean but therecertainly wouldn't be baseball In addition to having a beneficial interior we also have the right elements in the correctproportions In the most literal way we are made of the right stuff This is so crucial to our wellbeing that we are going to discuss it more fully in a minute but first we need to consider the tworemaining factors beginning with another one that is often overlooked We're a twin planet Not many of us normally think of the Moon as a companion planet but that isin effect what it is Most moons are tiny in relation to their master planet The Martian satellites ofPhobos and Deimos for_instance are only about ten kilometers in diameter Our Moon however ismore than a quarter the diameter of the Earth which makes ours the only planet in the solar systemwith a sizeable moon in comparison to itself except Pluto which doesn't really count because Plutois itself so small and what a difference that makes to us Without the Moon's steadying influence the Earth would wobble like a dying top with goodnessknows what consequences for climate and weather The Moon's steady gravitational influence keepsthe Earth spinning at the right speed and angle to provide the sort of stability necessary for the longand successful development of life This won't go on forever The Moon is slipping from our grasp ata rate of about inches a year In another two billion years it will have receded so far that it won'tkeep us steady and we will have to come up with some other solution but in the meantime you shouldthink of it as much more than just a pleasant feature in the night sky For a long time astronomers assumed that the Moon and Earth either formed together or that theEarth captured the Moon as it drifted by We now believe as you will recall from an earlier chapter that about billion_years_ago a Mars sized object slammed into Earth blowing out enough materialto create the Moon from the debris This was obviously a very good thing for us but especially so asit happened such a long time ago If it had happened in or last Wednesday clearly we wouldn'tbe nearly so pleased about it Which brings us to our fourth and in many ways most crucialconsideration Timing The universe is an amazingly fickle and eventful place and our existence within it is awonder If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events stretching back billion years orso hadn't played out in a particular manner at particular times if to take just one obvious instance the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped_out by a meteor when they were you might well be six inches long with whiskers and a tail and reading this in a burrow We don't really know for sure because we have nothing else to compare our_own existence to butit seems evident that if you wish to end up as a moderately advanced thinking society you need to beat the right end of a very long chain of outcomes involving reasonable periods of stabilityinterspersed with just the right amount of stress and challenge ice_ages appear to be especiallyhelpful in this regard and marked by a total absence of real cataclysm As we shall_see in the pagesthat remain to us we are very lucky to find ourselves in that position And on that note let us now turn briefly to the elements that made us There are ninety two naturally occurring elements on Earth plus a further twenty or so that have beencreated in labs but some of these we can immediately put to one side as in fact chemiststhemselves tend to do Not a few of our earthly chemicals are surprisingly little known Astatine forinstance is practically unstudied It has a name and a place on the periodic table next door to MarieCurie's polonium but almost nothing else The problem isn't scientific indifference but rarity Therejust isn't much astatine out there The most elusive element of all however appears to be francium which is so rare that it is thought that our entire planet may contain at any given moment fewer thantwenty francium atoms Altogether only about thirty of the naturally occurring elements arewidespread on Earth and barely half a dozen are of central importance to life As you might expect oxygen is our most abundant element accounting for just under percent ofthe Earth's_crust but after that the relative abundances are often surprising Who would guess forinstance that silicon is the second most common element on Earth or that titanium is tenth Abundance has little to do with their familiarity or utility to us Many of the more obscure elementsare actually more common than the better known ones There is more cerium on Earth than copper more neodymium and lanthanum than cobalt or nitrogen Tin barely makes it into the top fifty eclipsedby such relative obscurities as praseodymium samarium gadolinium and dysprosium Abundance also has little to do with ease of detection Aluminum is the fourth most commonelement on Earth accounting for nearly a tenth of everything that's underneath your feet but itsexistence wasn't even suspected until it was discovered in the nineteenth_century by Humphry Davy and for a long time after that it was treated as rare and precious Congress nearly put a shiny lining ofaluminum foil atop the Washington Monument to show what a classy and prosperous nation we hadbecome and the French imperial family in the same period discarded the state silver dinner serviceand replaced it with an aluminum one The fashion was cutting edge even if the knives weren't Nor does abundance necessarily relate to importance Carbon is only the fifteenth most commonelement accounting for a very modest percent of Earth's_crust but we would be lost without it What sets the carbon atom apart is that it is shamelessly promiscuous It is the party animal of theatomic world latching on to many other atoms including itself and holding tight forming molecularconga lines of hearty robustness the very trick of nature necessary to build proteins and DNA AsPaul Davies has written If it wasn't for carbon life as we know it would be impossible Probablyany sort of life would be impossible Yet carbon is not all that plentiful even in humans who sovitally depend on it Of every atoms in your_body are hydrogen are oxygen and just are carbon Other elements are critical not for creating life but for sustaining it We need iron to manufacturehemoglobin and without it we would die Cobalt is necessary for the creation of vitamin B Potassium and a very little sodium are literally good for your nerves Molybdenum manganese andvanadium help to keep your enzymes purring Zinc bless it oxidizes alcohol We have evolved to utilize or tolerate these things we could hardly be here otherwise but eventhen we live within narrow ranges of acceptance Selenium is vital to all of us but take in just a littletoo much and it will be the last thing you ever do The degree to which organisms require or toleratecertain elements is a relic of their evolution Sheep and cattle now graze side by side but actuallyhave very different mineral requirements Modern cattle need quite a lot of copper because theyevolved in parts of Europe and Africa where copper was abundant Sheep on the other hand evolvedin copper poor areas of Asia Minor As a rule and not surprisingly our tolerance for elements isdirectly proportionate to their abundance in the Earth's_crust We have evolved to expect and in somecases actually need the tiny amounts of rare elements that accumulate in the flesh or fiber that we eat But step up the doses in some cases by only a tiny amount and we can soon cross a threshold Muchof this is only imperfectly understood No one knows for example whether a tiny amount of arsenicis necessary for our well being or not Some authorities say it is some not All that is certain is thattoo much of it will kill you The properties of the elements can become more curious still when they are combined Oxygen andhydrogen for_instance are two of the most combustion friendly elements around but put themtogether and they make incombustible water Odder still in combination are sodium one of themost unstable of all elements and chlorine one of the most toxic Drop a small lump of pure sodiuminto ordinary water and it will explode with enough force to kill Chlorine is even more notoriouslyhazardous Though useful in small concentrations for killing microorganisms it's chlorine you smellin bleach in larger volumes it is lethal Chlorine was the element of choice for many of the poisongases of the First World_War And as many a sore eyed swimmer will attest even in exceedinglydilute form the human_body doesn't appreciate it Yet put these two nasty elements together and whatdo you get Sodium chloride common table salt By and large if an element doesn't naturally find its way into our systems if it isn't soluble inwater say we tend to be intolerant of it Lead poisons us because we were never exposed to it untilwe began to fashion it into food vessels and pipes for plumbing Not incidentally lead's symbol isPb for the Latin plumbum the source word for our modern plumbing The Romans also flavoredtheir wine with lead which may be part of the reason they are not the force they used to be As wehave seen elsewhere our_own performance with lead not to mention mercury cadmium and all theother industrial pollutants with which we routinely dose ourselves does not leave us a great_deal ofroom for smirking When elements don't occur naturally on Earth we have evolved no tolerance forthem and so they tend to be extremely toxic to us as with plutonium Our tolerance for plutonium iszero there is no level at which it is not going to make you want to lie down I have brought you a long way to make a small point a big part of the reason that Earth seems somiraculously accommodating is that we evolved to suit its conditions What we marvel at is not that itis suitable to life but that it is suitable to our life and hardly surprising really It may be that manyof the things that make it so splendid to us well proportioned Sun doting Moon sociable carbon more magma than you can shake a stick at and all the rest seem splendid simply because they arewhat we were born to count on No one can altogether say Other worlds may harbor beings thankful for their silvery lakes of mercury and drifting clouds ofammonia They may be delighted that their planet doesn't shake them silly with its grinding plates orspew messy gobs of lava over the landscape but rather exists in a permanent nontectonic tranquility Any visitors to Earth from afar would almost_certainly at the very least be bemused to find us livingin an atmosphere composed of nitrogen a gas sulkily disinclined to react with anything and oxygen which is so partial to combustion that we must place fire stations throughout our cities to protectourselves from its livelier effects But even if our visitors were oxygen breathing bipeds withshopping malls and a fondness for action movies it is unlikely that they would find Earth ideal Wecouldn't even give them lunch because all our foods contain traces of manganese selenium zinc andother elemental particles at_least some of which would be poisonous to them To them Earth might notseem a wondrously congenial place at all The physicist Richard_Feynman used to make a joke about a posteriori conclusions as they arecalled You know the most amazing thing happened to me tonight he would say I saw a car withthe license plate ARW Can you imagine Of all the millions of license plates in the state whatwas the chance that I would see that particular one tonight Amazing His point of course was thatit is easy to make any banal situation seem extraordinary if you treat it as fateful So it is possible that the events and conditions that led to the rise of life on Earth are not quite asextraordinary as we like to think Still they were extraordinary enough and one thing is certain theywill have to do until we find some better INTO THE TROPOSPHERETHANK GOODNESS FOR the atmosphere It keeps us warm Without it Earth would be a lifelessball of ice with an average temperature of minus degrees_Fahrenheit In addition the atmosphereabsorbs or deflects incoming swarms of cosmic_rays charged particles ultraviolet rays and the like Altogether the gaseous padding of the atmosphere is equivalent to a fifteen foot thickness ofprotective concrete and without it these invisible visitors from space would slice through us like tinydaggers Even raindrops would pound us senseless if it weren't for the atmosphere's slowing drag The most striking thing about our atmosphere is that there isn't very much of it It extends upwardfor about miles which might seem reasonably bounteous when viewed from ground level but ifyou shrank the Earth to the size of a standard desktop globe it would only be about the thickness of acouple of coats of varnish For scientific convenience the atmosphere is divided into four unequal layers troposphere stratosphere mesosphere and ionosphere now often called the thermosphere The troposphere isthe part that's dear to us It alone contains enough warmth and oxygen to allow us to function thougheven it swiftly becomes uncongenial to life as you climb up through it From ground level to itshighest point the troposphere or turning sphere is about ten miles_thick at the equator and no morethan six or seven miles high in the temperate latitudes where most of us live Eighty percent of theatmosphere's mass virtually all the water and thus virtually all the weather are contained within thisthin and wispy layer There really isn't much between you and oblivion Beyond the troposphere is the stratosphere When you see the top of a storm cloud flattening outinto the classic anvil shape you are looking at the boundary between the troposphere andstratosphere This invisible ceiling is known as the tropopause and was discovered in by aFrenchman in a balloon L on Philippe Teisserenc de Bort Pause in this sense doesn't mean to stopmomentarily but to cease altogether it's from the same Greek root as menopause Even at its greatestextent the tropopause is not very distant A fast elevator of the sort used in modern skyscrapers couldget you there in about twenty minutes though you would be well advised not to make the trip Such arapid ascent without pressurization would at the very least result in severe cerebral and pulmonaryedemas a dangerous excess of fluids in the body's tissues When the doors opened at the viewingplatform anyone inside would almost_certainly be dead or dying Even a more measured ascentwould be accompanied by a great_deal of discomfort The temperature six miles up can be degrees_Fahrenheit and you would need or at_least very much appreciate supplementary oxygen After you have left the troposphere the temperature soon warms up again to about degreesFahrenheit thanks to the absorptive effects of ozone something else de Bort discovered on his daring ascent It then plunges to as low as degrees_Fahrenheit in the mesosphere beforeskyrocketing to degrees_Fahrenheit or more in the aptly named but very erratic thermosphere where temperatures can vary by a thousand degrees from day to night though it must be said that temperature at such a height becomes a somewhat notional concept Temperature is really just ameasure of the activity of molecules At sea level air molecules are so thick that one molecule canmove only the tiniest distance about three millionths of an inch to be precise before banging intoanother Because trillions of molecules are constantly colliding a lot of heat gets exchanged But atthe height of the thermosphere at fifty miles or more the air is so thin that any two molecules will bemiles apart and hardly ever come in contact So although each molecule is very warm there are fewinteractions between them and thus little heat transference This is good_news for satellites andspaceships because if the exchange of heat were more efficient any man made object orbiting at thatlevel would burst into flame Even so spaceships have to take care in the outer atmosphere particularly on return trips to Earth as the space shuttle Columbia demonstrated all too tragically in February Although theatmosphere is very thin if a craft comes in at too steep an angle more than about degrees or tooswiftly it can strike enough molecules to generate drag of an exceedingly combustible nature Conversely if an incoming vehicle hit the thermosphere at too shallow an angle it could well bounceback into space like a pebble skipped across water But you needn't venture to the edge of the atmosphere to be reminded of what hopelessly groundhugging beings we are As anyone who has spent time in a lofty city will know you don't have to risetoo many thousands of feet from sea level before your_body begins to protest Even experiencedmountaineers with the benefits of fitness training and bottled oxygen quickly become vulnerable atheight to confusion nausea exhaustion frostbite hypothermia migraine loss of appetite and a greatmany other stumbling dysfunctions In a hundred emphatic ways the human_body reminds its ownerthat it wasn't designed to operate so far above sea level Even under the most favorable circumstances the climber Peter Habeler has written ofconditions atop Everest every step at that altitude demands a colossal effort of will You must forceyourself to make every movement reach for every handhold You are perpetually threatened by aleaden deadly fatigue In The Other Side of Everest the British mountaineer and filmmaker MattDickinson records how Howard Somervell on a British expedition up Everest found himselfchoking to death after a piece of infected flesh came loose and blocked his windpipe With asupreme effort Somervell managed to cough up the obstruction It turned_out to be the entire mucuslining of his larynx Bodily distress is notorious above feet the area known to climbers as the Death Zone but many people become severely debilitated even dangerously ill at heights of no more than feet or so Susceptibility has little to do with fitness Grannies sometimes caper about in loftysituations while their fitter offspring are reduced to helpless groaning heaps until conveyed to loweraltitudes The absolute limit of human tolerance for continuous living appears to be about meters or feet but even people conditioned to living at altitude could not tolerate such heights for long Frances Ashcroft in Life at the Extremes notes that there are Andean sulfur mines at meters but that the miners prefer to descend meters each evening and climb back up the following day rather than live continuously at that elevation People who habitually live at altitude have often spentthousands of years developing disproportionately large chests and lungs increasing their density ofoxygen bearing red blood_cells by almost a third though there are limits to how much thickening withred cells the blood supply can stand Moreover above meters even the most well adaptedwomen cannot provide a growing fetus with enough oxygen to bring it to its full term In the s when people began to make experimental balloon ascents in Europe something thatsurprised them was how chilly it got as they rose The temperature drops about degrees Fahrenheitwith every thousand feet you climb Logic would seem to indicate that the closer you get to a sourceof heat the warmer you would feel Part of the explanation is that you are not really getting nearer theSun in any meaningful sense The Sun is ninety three million miles_away To move a couple ofthousand feet closer to it is like taking one step closer to a bushfire in Australia when you arestanding in Ohio and expecting to smell smoke The answer again takes us back to the question of thedensity of molecules in the atmosphere Sunlight energizes atoms It increases the rate at which theyjiggle and jounce and in their enlivened state they crash into one another releasing heat When youfeel the sun warm on your back on a summer's day it's really excited atoms you feel The higher youclimb the fewer molecules there are and so the fewer collisions between them Air is deceptive stuff Even at sea level we tend to think of the air as being ethereal and all butweightless In_fact it has plenty of bulk and that bulk often exerts itself As a marine scientist namedWyville Thomson wrote more than a century ago We sometimes find when we get up in themorning by a rise of an inch in the barometer that nearly half a ton has been quietly piled upon usduring the night but we experience no inconvenience rather a feeling of exhilaration and buoyancy since it requires a little less exertion to move our bodies in the denser medium The reason you don'tfeel crushed under that extra half ton of pressure is the same reason your_body would not be crusheddeep beneath the sea it is made mostly of incompressible fluids which push back equalizing thepressures within and without But get air in motion as with a hurricane or even a stiff breeze and you will quickly be remindedthat it has very considerable mass Altogether there are about million million tons of air aroundus million tons for every square mile of the planet a not inconsequential volume When you getmillions of tons of atmosphere rushing past at thirty or forty miles an_hour it's hardly a surprise thatlimbs snap and roof tiles go flying As Anthony Smith notes a typical weather front may consist of million tons of cold air pinned beneath a billion_tons of warmer air Hardly a wonder that theresult is at times meteorologically exciting Certainly there is no shortage of energy in the world above our heads One thunderstorm it hasbeen calculated can contain an amount of energy equivalent to four days' use of electricity for thewhole United_States In the right conditions storm clouds can rise to heights of six to ten miles andcontain updrafts and downdrafts of one hundred miles an_hour These are often side by side which iswhy pilots don't want to fly through them In all the internal turmoil particles within the cloud pick upelectrical charges For reasons not entirely understood the lighter particles tend to become positivelycharged and to be wafted by air currents to the top of the cloud The heavier particles linger at thebase accumulating negative charges These negatively charged particles have a powerful urge to rushto the positively charged Earth and good luck to anything that gets in their way A bolt of lightningtravels at miles an_hour and can heat the air around it to a decidedly crisp degreesFahrenheit several times hotter than the surface of the sun At any one moment thunderstormsare in progress around the globe some a day Day and night across the planet every secondabout a hundred lightning bolts hit the ground The sky is a lively place Much of our knowledge of what goes on up there is surprisingly recent Jet streams usually locatedabout to feet up can bowl along at up to miles an_hour and vastly influenceweather systems over whole continents yet their existence wasn't suspected until pilots began to flyinto them during the Second World_War Even now a great_deal of atmospheric phenomena is barelyunderstood A form of wave motion popularly known as clear air turbulence occasionally enlivensairplane flights About twenty such incidents a year are serious enough to need reporting They are notassociated with cloud structures or anything_else that can be detected visually or by radar They arejust pockets of startling turbulence in the middle of tranquil skies In a typical incident a plane enroute from Singapore to Sydney was flying over central Australia in calm conditions when it suddenlyfell three hundred feet enough to fling unsecured people against the ceiling Twelve people wereinjured one seriously No one knows what causes such disruptive cells of air The process that moves air around in the atmosphere is the same process that drives the internalengine of the planet namely convection Moist warm air from the equatorial regions rises until it hitsthe barrier of the tropopause and spreads out As it travels away from the equator and cools it sinks When it hits bottom some of the sinking air looks for an area of low pressure to fill and heads backfor the equator completing the circuit At the equator the convection process is generally stable and the weather predictably fair but intemperate zones the patterns are far more seasonal localized and random which results in an endlessbattle between systems of high pressure air and low Low pressure systems are created by rising air which conveys water molecules into the sky forming clouds and eventually rain Warm air can holdmore moisture than cool air which is why tropical and summer storms tend to be the heaviest Thuslow areas tend to be associated_with clouds and rain and highs generally spell sunshine and fairweather When two such systems meet it often becomes manifest in the clouds For instance stratusclouds those unlovable featureless sprawls that give us our overcast skies happen whenmoisture bearing updrafts lack the oomph to break through a level of more stable air above andinstead spread out like smoke hitting a ceiling Indeed if you watch a smoker sometime you can get avery good idea of how things work by watching how smoke rises from a cigarette in a still room Atfirst it goes straight up this is called a laminar flow if you need to impress anyone and then itspreads out in a diffused wavy layer The greatest supercomputer in the world taking measurementsin the most carefully controlled environment cannot tell you what forms these ripplings will take soyou can imagine the difficulties that confront meteorologists when they try to predict such motions in aspinning windy large scale world What we do know is that because heat from the Sun is unevenly distributed differences in airpressure arise on the planet Air can't abide this so it rushes around trying to equalize thingseverywhere Wind is simply the air's way of trying to keep things in balance Air always flows fromareas of high pressure to areas of low pressure as you would expect think of anything with air underpressure a balloon or an air tank and think how insistently that pressured air wants to getsomeplace else and the greater the discrepancy in pressures the faster the wind blows Incidentally wind speeds like most things that accumulate grow exponentially so a wind blowingat two hundred miles an_hour is not simply ten times stronger than a wind blowing at twenty miles anhour but a hundred times stronger and hence that much more destructive Introduce several milliontons of air to this accelerator effect and the result can be exceedingly energetic A tropical hurricanecan release in twenty four hours as much energy as a rich medium sized nation like Britain or Franceuses in a year The impulse of the atmosphere to seek equilibrium was first suspected by Edmond Halley theman who was everywhere and elaborated upon in the eighteenth_century by his fellow BritonGeorge Hadley who saw that rising and falling columns of air tended to produce cells known eversince as Hadley cells Though a lawyer by profession Hadley had a keen interest in the weather he was after all English and also suggested a link between his cells the Earth's spin and theapparent deflections of air that give us our trade winds However it was an engineering professor atthe cole Polytechnique in Paris Gustave Gaspard de Coriolis who worked out the details of theseinteractions in and thus we call it the Coriolis effect Coriolis's other distinction at the schoolwas to introduce watercoolers which are still known there as Corios apparently The Earthrevolves at a brisk miles an_hour at the equator though as you move toward the poles the rateslopes off considerably to about miles an_hour in London or Paris for_instance The reason forthis is self evident when you think about it If you are on the equator the spinning Earth has to carryyou quite a distance about kilometers to get you back to the same spot If you stand besidethe North Pole however you may need travel only a few feet to complete a revolution yet in bothcases it takes twenty four hours to get you back to where you began Therefore it follows that thecloser you get to the equator the faster you must be spinning The Coriolis effect explains why anything moving through the air in a straight line laterally to theEarth's spin will given enough distance seem to curve to the right in the northern hemisphere and tothe left in the southern as the Earth revolves beneath it The standard way to envision this is toimagine yourself at the center of a large carousel and tossing a ball to someone positioned on theedge By the time the ball gets to the perimeter the target person has moved on and the ball passesbehind him From his perspective it looks as if it has curved away from him That is the Corioliseffect and it is what gives weather systems their curl and sends hurricanes spinning off like tops TheCoriolis effect is also why naval guns firing artillery shells have to adjust to left or right a shell firedfifteen miles would otherwise deviate by about a hundred yards and plop harmlessly into the sea Considering the practical and psychological importance of the weather to nearly everyone it'ssurprising that meteorology didn't really get going as a science until shortly before the turn of thenineteenth century though the term meteorology itself had been around since when it wascoined by a T Granger in a book of logic Part of the problem was that successful meteorology requires the precise measurement oftemperatures and thermometers for a long time proved more difficult to make than you might expect An accurate reading was dependent on getting a very even bore in a glass tube and that wasn't easy todo The first person to crack the problem was Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit a Dutch maker ofinstruments who produced an accurate thermometer in However for reasons unknown hecalibrated the instrument in a way that put freezing at degrees and boiling at degrees From theoutset this numeric eccentricity bothered some people and in Anders Celsius a Swedishastronomer came up with a competing scale In proof of the proposition that inventors seldom getmatters entirely right Celsius made boiling point zero and freezing point on his scale but thatwas soon reversed The person most frequently identified as the father of modern meteorology was an Englishpharmacist named Luke Howard who came to prominence at the beginning of the nineteenth_century Howard is chiefly remembered now for giving cloud types their names in Although he was anactive and respected member of the Linnaean Society and employed Linnaean principles in his newscheme Howard chose the rather more obscure Askesian Society as the forum to announce his newsystem of classification The Askesian Society you may just recall from an earlier chapter was thebody whose members were unusually devoted to the pleasures of nitrous oxide so we can only hopethey treated Howard's presentation with the sober attention it deserved It is a point on which Howardscholars are curiously silent Howard divided clouds into three groups stratus for the layered clouds cumulus for the fluffy ones the word means heaped in Latin and cirrus meaning curled for the high thin featheryformations that generally presage colder weather To these he subsequently added a fourth term nimbus from the Latin for cloud for a rain cloud The beauty of Howard's system was that thebasic components could be freely recombined to describe every shape and size of passing cloud stratocumulus cirrostratus cumulocongestus and so on It was an immediate hit and not just inEngland The poet Johann von Goethe in Germany was so taken with the system that he dedicated fourpoems to Howard Howard's system has been much added to over the years so much so that the encyclopedic if littleread International Cloud Atlas runs to two volumes but interestingly virtually all the post Howardcloud types mammatus pileus nebulosis spissatus floccus and mediocris are a sampling havenever caught on with anyone outside meteorology and not terribly much there I'm told Incidentally the first much thinner edition of that atlas produced in divided clouds into ten basic types ofwhich the plumpest and most cushiony looking was number nine cumulonimbus That seems tohave been the source of the expression to be on cloud nine For all the heft and fury of the occasional anvil headed storm cloud the average cloud is actually abenign and surprisingly insubstantial thing A fluffy summer cumulus several hundred yards to a sidemay contain no more than twenty_five or thirty gallons of water about enough to fill a bathtub asJames Trefil has noted You can get some sense of the immaterial quality of clouds by strollingthrough fog which is after all nothing more than a cloud that lacks the will to fly To quote Trefilagain If you walk yards through a typical fog you will come into contact with only about half acubic inch of water not enough to give you a decent drink In consequence clouds are not greatreservoirs of water Only about percent of the Earth's fresh water is floating around above us atany moment Depending on where it falls the prognosis for a water molecule varies widely If it lands in fertilesoil it will be soaked up by plants or reevaporated directly within hours or days If it finds its waydown to the groundwater however it may not see sunlight again for many years thousands if it getsreally deep When you look at a lake you are looking at a collection of molecules that have beenthere on average for about a decade In the ocean the residence time is thought to be more like ahundred years Altogether about percent of water molecules in a rainfall are returned to theatmosphere within a day or two Once evaporated they spend no more than a week or so Drury saystwelve days in the sky before falling again as rain Evaporation is a swift process as you can easily gauge by the fate of a puddle on a summer's day Even something as large as the Mediterranean would dry out in a thousand years if it were notcontinually replenished Such an event occurred a little under six million_years_ago and provokedwhat is known to science as the Messinian Salinity Crisis What happened was that continentalmovement closed the Strait of Gibraltar As the Mediterranean dried its evaporated contents fell asfreshwater rain into other seas mildly diluting their saltiness indeed making them just dilute enoughto freeze over larger areas than normal The enlarged area of ice bounced back more of the Sun's heatand pushed Earth into an ice_age So at_least the theory goes What is certainly true as far as we can tell is that a little change in the Earth's dynamics can haverepercussions beyond our imagining Such an event as we shall_see a little further on may even havecreated us Oceans are the real powerhouse of the planet's surface behavior Indeed meteorologists increasinglytreat oceans and atmosphere as a single system which is why we must give them a little of ourattention here Water is marvelous at holding and transporting heat Every_day the Gulf Streamcarries an amount of heat to Europe equivalent to the world's output of coal for ten years which iswhy Britain and Ireland have such mild winters compared with Canada and Russia But water also warms slowly which is why lakes and swimming pools are cold even on the hottestdays For that reason there tends to be a lag in the official astronomical start of a season and theactual feeling that that season has started So spring may officially start in the northern hemisphere inMarch but it doesn't feel like it in most places until April at the very earliest The oceans are not one uniform mass of water Their differences in temperature salinity depth density and so on have huge effects on how they move heat around which in turn affects climate TheAtlantic for_instance is saltier than the Pacific and a good thing too The saltier water is the denserit is and dense water sinks Without its extra burden of salt the Atlantic currents would proceed up tothe Arctic warming the North Pole but depriving Europe of all that kindly warmth The main agent ofheat transfer on Earth is what is known as thermohaline circulation which originates in slow deepcurrents far below the surface a process first detected by the scientist adventurer Count vonRumford in What happens is that surface waters as they get to the vicinity of Europe growdense and sink to great depths and begin a slow trip back to the southern hemisphere When they reachAntarctica they are caught up in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current where they are driven onwardinto the Pacific The process is very slow it can take years for water to travel from the NorthAtlantic to the mid Pacific but the volumes of heat and water they move are very considerable andthe influence on the climate is enormous As for the question of how anyone could possibly figure out how long it takes a drop of water toget from one ocean to another the answer is that scientists can measure compounds in the water likechlorofluorocarbons and work out how long it has been since they were last in the air By comparinga lot of measurements from different depths and locations they can reasonably chart the water'smovement Thermohaline circulation not only moves heat around but also helps to stir up nutrients as thecurrents rise and fall making greater volumes of the ocean habitable for fish and other marinecreatures Unfortunately it appears the circulation may also be very sensitive to change According tocomputer simulations even a modest dilution of the ocean's salt content from increased melting ofthe Greenland ice_sheet for_instance could disrupt the cycle disastrously The seas do one other great favor for us They soak up tremendous volumes of carbon and providea means for it to be safely locked away One of the oddities of our solar_system is that the Sun burnsabout percent more brightly now than when the solar_system was young This should have resultedin a much warmer Earth Indeed as the English geologist Aubrey Manning has put it This colossalchange should have had an absolutely catastrophic effect on the Earth and yet it appears that ourworld has hardly been affected So what keeps the world stable and cool Life does Trillions upon trillions of tiny marine organisms that most of us have never heard of foraminiferans and coccoliths and calcareous algae capture atmospheric carbon in the form ofcarbon dioxide when it falls as rain and use it in combination with other things to make their tinyshells By locking the carbon up in their shells they keep it from being reevaporated into theatmosphere where it would build up dangerously as a greenhouse gas Eventually all the tinyforaminiferans and coccoliths and so on die and fall to the bottom of the sea where they arecompressed into limestone It is remarkable when you behold an extraordinary natural feature like theWhite Cliffs of Dover in England to reflect that it is made up of nothing but tiny deceased marineorganisms but even more remarkable when you realize how much carbon they cumulativelysequester A six inch cube of Dover chalk will contain well over a thousand liters of compressedcarbon dioxide that would otherwise be doing us no good at all Altogether there is about twentythousand times as much carbon locked away in the Earth's rocks as in the atmosphere Eventuallymuch of that limestone will end up feeding volcanoes and the carbon will return to the atmosphereand fall to the Earth in rain which is why the whole is called the long term carbon cycle The processtakes a very long time about half a million_years for a typical carbon atom but in the absence ofany other disturbance it works remarkably well at keeping the climate stable Unfortunately human_beings have a careless predilection for disrupting this cycle by putting lots ofextra carbon into the atmosphere whether the foraminiferans are ready for it or not Since it hasbeen estimated we have lofted about a hundred billion_tons of extra carbon into the air a total thatincreases by about seven billion_tons each year Overall that's not actually all that much Nature mostly through the belchings of volcanoes and the decay of plants sends about billion_tons ofcarbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year nearly thirty times as much as we do with our cars andfactories But you have only to look at the haze that hangs over our cities to see what a difference ourcontribution makes We know from samples of very old ice that the natural level of carbon_dioxide in the atmosphere that is before we started inflating it with industrial activity is about parts per million By when people in lab coats started to pay attention to it it had risen to parts per million Today it is over parts per million and rising by roughly one quarter of percent a year By theend of the twenty first century it is forecast to rise to about parts per million So far the Earth's oceans and forests which also pack away a lot of carbon have managed to saveus from ourselves but as Peter Cox of the British Meteorological Office puts it There is a criticalthreshold where the natural biosphere stops buffering us from the effects of our emissions and actuallystarts to amplify them The fear is that there would be a runaway increase in the Earth's warming Unable to adapt many trees and other plants would die releasing their stores of carbon and adding tothe problem Such cycles have occasionally happened in the distant past even without a humancontribution The good_news is that even here nature is quite wonderful It is almost certain thateventually the carbon cycle would reassert itself and return the Earth to a situation of stability andhappiness The last time this happened it took a mere sixty thousand years THE BOUNDING MAINIMAGINE TRYING TO live in a world dominated by dihydrogen oxide a compound that has no tasteor smell and is so variable in its properties that it is generally benign but at other times swiftly lethal Depending on its state it can scald you or freeze you In the presence of certain organic molecules itcan form carbonic acids so nasty that they can strip the leaves from trees and eat the faces off statuary In bulk when agitated it can strike with a fury that no human edifice could withstand Even for thosewho have learned to live with it it is an often murderous substance We call it water Water is everywhere A potato is percent water a cow percent a bacterium percent Atomato at percent is little but water Even humans are percent water making us more liquidthan solid by a margin of almost two to one Water is strange stuff It is formless and transparent andyet we long to be beside it It has no taste and yet we love the taste of it We will travel greatdistances and pay small fortunes to see it in sunshine And even though we know it is dangerous anddrowns tens of thousands of people every year we can't wait to frolic in it Because water is so ubiquitous we tend to overlook what an extraordinary substance it is Almostnothing about it can be used to make reliable predictions about the properties of other liquids andvice versa If you knew nothing of water and based your assumptions on the behavior of compoundsmost chemically akin to it hydrogen selenide or hydrogen sulphide notably you would expect it toboil at minus degrees_Fahrenheit and to be a gas at room temperature Most liquids when chilled contract by about percent Water does too but only down to a point Once it is within whispering distance of freezing it begins perversely beguilingly extremelyimprobably to expand By the time it is solid it is almost a tenth more voluminous than it wasbefore Because it expands ice floats on water an utterly bizarre property according to JohnGribbin If it lacked this splendid waywardness ice would sink and lakes and oceans would freezefrom the bottom up Without surface ice to hold heat in the water's warmth would radiate away leaving it even chillier and creating yet more ice Soon even the oceans would freeze and almostcertainly stay that way for a very long time probably forever hardly the conditions to nurture life Thankfully for us water seems unaware of the rules of chemistry or laws of physics Everyone knows that water's chemical formula is H_O which means that it consists of one largishoxygen atom with two smaller hydrogen atoms attached to it The hydrogen atoms cling fiercely totheir oxygen host but also make casual bonds with other water molecules The nature of a watermolecule means that it engages in a kind of dance with other water molecules briefly pairing and thenmoving on like the ever changing partners in a quadrille to use Robert Kunzig's nice phrase A glassof water may not appear terribly lively but every molecule in it is changing partners billions of timesa second That's_why water molecules stick together to form bodies like puddles and lakes but not sotightly that they can't be easily separated as when for_instance you dive into a pool of them At anygiven moment only percent of them are actually touching In one sense the bond is very strong it is why water molecules can flow uphill when siphonedand why water droplets on a car hood show such a singular determination to bead with their partners It is also why water has surface tension The molecules at the surface are attracted more powerfullyto the like molecules beneath and beside them than to the air molecules above This creates a sort ofmembrane strong enough to support insects and skipping stones It is what gives the sting to a bellyflop I hardly need point out that we would be lost without it Deprived of water the human_body rapidlyfalls apart Within days the lips vanish as if amputated the gums blacken the nose withers to half itslength and the skin so contracts around the eyes as to prevent blinking Water is so vital to us that itis easy to overlook that all but the smallest fraction of the water on Earth is poisonous to us deadlypoisonous because of the salts within it We need salt to live but only in very small amounts and seawater contains way more aboutseventy times more salt than we can safely metabolize A typical liter of seawater will contain onlyabout teaspoons of common salt the kind we sprinkle on food but much larger amounts of otherelements compounds and other dissolved solids which are collectively known as salts Theproportions of these salts and minerals in our tissues is uncannily similar to seawater we sweat andcry seawater as Margulis and Sagan have put it but curiously we cannot tolerate them as an input Take a lot of salt into your_body and your metabolism very quickly goes into crisis From every cell water molecules rush off like so many volunteer firemen to try to dilute and carry off the suddenintake of salt This leaves the cells dangerously short of the water they need to carry out their normalfunctions They become in a word dehydrated In extreme situations dehydration will lead toseizures unconsciousness and brain damage Meanwhile the overworked blood_cells carry the saltto the kidneys which eventually become overwhelmed and shut down Without functioning kidneysyou die That is why we don't drink seawater There are million cubic miles of water on Earth and that is all we're ever going to get Thesystem is closed practically speaking nothing can be added or subtracted The water you drink hasbeen around doing its job since the Earth was young By billion_years_ago the oceans had at leastmore or less achieved their present volumes The water realm is known as the hydrosphere and it is overwhelmingly oceanic Ninety sevenpercent of all the water on Earth is in the seas the greater part of it in the Pacific which covers halfthe planet and is bigger_than all the landmasses put together Altogether the Pacific holds just overhalf of all the ocean water percent to be precise the Atlantic has percent and the IndianOcean percent leaving just percent to be accounted for by all the other seas The averagedepth of the ocean is miles with the Pacific on average about a thousand feet deeper than theAtlantic and Indian Oceans Altogether percent of the planet's surface is ocean more than a miledeep As Philip Ball notes we would better call our planet not Earth but Water Of the percent of Earth's water that is fresh most exists as ice_sheets Only the tiniest amount percent is found in lakes rivers and reservoirs and an even smaller part just percent exists in clouds or as vapor Nearly percent of the planet's ice is in Antarctica and most of therest is in Greenland Go to the South Pole and you will be standing on nearly two miles of ice at theNorth Pole just fifteen feet of it Antarctica alone has six million cubic miles of ice enough to raisethe oceans by a height of two hundred feet if it all melted But if all the water in the atmosphere fell asrain evenly everywhere the oceans would deepen by only an inch Sea level incidentally is an almost entirely notional concept Seas are not level at all Tides winds the Coriolis force and other effects alter water levels considerably from one ocean to anotherand within oceans as well The Pacific is about a foot and a half higher along its western edge aconsequence of the centrifugal force created by the Earth's spin Just as when you pull on a tub ofwater the water tends to flow toward the other end as if reluctant to come with you so the eastwardspin of Earth piles water up against the ocean's western margins Considering the age old importance of the seas to us it is striking how long it took the world totake a scientific interest in them Until well into the nineteenth_century most of what was known aboutthe oceans was based on what washed ashore or came up in fishing nets and nearly all that waswritten was based more on anecdote and supposition than on physical evidence In the s theBritish naturalist Edward Forbes surveyed ocean beds throughout the Atlantic and Mediterranean anddeclared that there was no life at all in the seas below feet It seemed a reasonable assumption There was no light at that depth so no plant life and the pressures of water at such depths wereknown to be extreme So it came as something of a surprise when in one of the firsttransatlantic telegraph cables was hauled up for repairs from more than two miles down and it wasfound to be thickly encrusted with corals clams and other living detritus The first really organized investigation of the seas didn't come until when a joint expeditionbetween the British Museum the Royal_Society and the British government set forth from Portsmouthon a former warship called HMS Challenger For three and a half years they sailed the world sampling waters netting fish and hauling a dredge through sediments It was evidently dreary work Out of a complement of scientists and crew one in four jumped ship and eight more died or wentmad driven to distraction by the mind numbing routine of years of dredging in the words of thehistorian Samantha Weinberg But they sailed across almost nautical miles of sea collectedover new species of marine organisms gathered enough information to create a fifty volumereport which took nineteen years to put together and gave the world the name of a new scientificdiscipline oceanography They also discovered by means of depth measurements that thereappeared to be submerged mountains in the mid Atlantic prompting some excited observers tospeculate that they had found the lost continent of Atlantis Because the institutional world mostly ignored the seas it fell to devoted and very occasional amateurs to tell us what was down there Modern deep water exploration begins with CharlesWilliam Beebe and Otis Barton in Although they were equal partners the more colorful Beebehas always received far more written attention Born in into a well to do family in New YorkCity Beebe studied zoology at Columbia University then took a job as a birdkeeper at the New YorkZoological Society Tiring of that he decided to adopt the life of an adventurer and for the nextquarter century traveled extensively through Asia and South_America with a succession of attractivefemale assistants whose jobs were inventively described as historian and technicist or assistant infish problems He supported these endeavors with a succession of popular books with titles likeEdge of the Jungle and Jungle Days though he also produced some respectable books on wildlifeand ornithology In the mid_s on a trip to the Gal pagos Islands he discovered the delights of dangling ashe described deep sea diving Soon_afterward he teamed up with Barton who came from an evenwealthier family had also attended Columbia and also longed for adventure Although Beebe nearlyalways gets the credit it was in fact Barton who designed the first bathysphere from the Greek wordfor deep and funded the cost of its construction It was a tiny and necessarily robustchamber made of cast iron inches thick and with two small portholes containing quartz blocksthree inches thick It held two men but only if they were prepared to become extremely wellacquainted Even by the standards of the age the technology was unsophisticated The sphere had nomaneuverability it simply hung on the end of a long cable and only the most primitive breathingsystem to neutralize their own carbon_dioxide they set out open cans of soda lime and to absorbmoisture they opened a small tub of calcium chloride over which they sometimes waved palm frondsto encourage chemical reactions But the nameless little bathysphere did the job it was intended to do On the first dive in June in the Bahamas Barton and Beebe set a world record by descending to feet By they hadpushed the record to feet where it would stay until after the war Barton was confident thedevice was safe to a depth of feet though the strain on every bolt and rivet was audibly evidentwith each fathom they descended At any depth it was brave and risky work At feet their littleporthole was subjected to nineteen tons of pressure per square inch Death at such a depth would havebeen instantaneous as Beebe never failed to observe in his many books articles and radiobroadcasts Their main concern however was that the shipboard winch straining to hold on to ametal ball and two tons of steel cable would snap and send the two men plunging to the seafloor Insuch an event nothing could have saved them The one thing their descents didn't produce was a great_deal of worthwhile science Although theyencountered many creatures that had not been seen before the limits of visibility and the fact thatneither of the intrepid aquanauts was a trained oceanographer meant they often weren't able todescribe their findings in the kind of detail that real scientists craved The sphere didn't carry anexternal light merely a watt bulb they could hold up to the window but the water below fivehundred feet was practically impenetrable anyway and they were peering into it through three inchesof quartz so anything they hoped to view would have to be nearly as interested in them as they werein it About all they could report in consequence was that there were a lot of strange things downthere On one dive in Beebe was startled to spy a giant serpent more than twenty feet long andvery wide It passed too swiftly to be more than a shadow Whatever it was nothing like it has beenseen by anyone since Because of such vagueness their reports were generally ignored by academics After their record breaking descent of Beebe lost interest in diving and moved on to otheradventures but Barton persevered To his credit Beebe always told anyone who asked that Bartonwas the real brains behind the enterprise but Barton seemed unable to step from the shadows He too wrote thrilling accounts of their underwater adventures and even starred in a Hollywood moviecalled Titans of the Deep featuring a bathysphere and many exciting and largely fictionalizedencounters with aggressive giant squid and the like He even advertised Camel cigarettes They don'tgive me jittery nerves In he increased the depth record by percent with a dive to feet in the Pacific Ocean near California but the world seemed determined to overlook him Onenewspaper reviewer of Titans of the Deep actually thought the star of the film was Beebe Nowadays Barton is lucky to get a mention At all events he was about to be comprehensively eclipsed by a father and son team fromSwitzerland Auguste and Jacques Piccard who were designing a new type of probe called abathyscaphe meaning deep boat Christened Trieste after the Italian city in which it was built thenew device maneuvered independently though it did little more than just go up and down On one ofits first dives in early it descended to below feet nearly three times Barton's recordbreaking dive of six years earlier But deep sea dives required a great_deal of costly support and thePiccards were gradually going broke In they did a deal with the U_S Navy which gave the Navy ownership but left them incontrol Now flush with funds the Piccards rebuilt the vessel giving it walls five inches thick andshrinking the windows to just two inches in diameter little more than peepholes But it was nowstrong enough to withstand truly enormous pressures and in January Jacques Piccard andLieutenant Don Walsh of the U_S Navy sank slowly to the bottom of the ocean's deepest canyon theMariana Trench some miles off Guam in the western Pacific and discovered not incidentally by Harry Hess with his fathometer It took just under four hours to fall feet or almost sevenmiles Although the pressure at that depth was nearly pounds per square inch they noticedwith surprise that they disturbed a bottom dwelling flatfish just as they touched down They had nofacilities for taking photographs so there is no visual record of the event After just twenty minutes at the world's deepest point they returned to the surface It was the onlyoccasion on which human_beings have gone so deep Forty years later the question that naturally occurs is Why has no one gone back since To beginwith further dives were vigorously opposed by Vice Admiral Hyman G Rickover a man who had alively temperament forceful views and most pertinently control of the departmental checkbook Hethought underwater exploration a waste of resources and pointed_out that the Navy was not a researchinstitute The nation moreover was about to become fully preoccupied with space travel and thequest to send a man to the Moon which made deep sea investigations seem unimportant and ratherold fashioned But the decisive consideration was that the Trieste descent didn't actually achievemuch As a Navy official explained years later We didn't learn a hell of a lot from it other than thatwe could do it Why do it again It was in short a long way to go to find a flatfish and expensivetoo Repeating the exercise today it has been estimated would cost at_least million When underwater researchers realized that the Navy had no intention of pursuing a promisedexploration program there was a pained outcry Partly to placate its critics the Navy providedfunding for a more advanced submersible to be operated by the Woods Hole OceanographicInstitution of Massachusetts Called Alvin in somewhat contracted honor of the oceanographer AllynC Vine it would be a fully maneuverable minisubmarine though it wouldn't go anywhere near asdeep as the Trieste There was just one problem the designers couldn't find anyone willing to buildit According to William J Broad in The Universe Below No big company like General Dynamics which made submarines for the Navy wanted to take on a project disparaged by both the Bureau ofShips and Admiral Rickover the gods of naval patronage Eventually not to say improbably Alvinwas constructed by General Mills the food company at a factory where it made the machines toproduce breakfast cereals As for what else was down there people really had very little idea Well into the s the bestmaps available to oceanographers were overwhelmingly based on a little detail from scatteredsurveys going back to grafted onto essentially an ocean of guesswork The Navy had excellentcharts with which to guide submarines through canyons and around guyots but it didn't wish suchinformation to fall into Soviet hands so it kept its knowledge classified Academics therefore had tomake do with sketchy and antiquated surveys or rely on hopeful surmise Even today our knowledgeof the ocean floors remains remarkably low resolution If you look at the Moon with a standardbackyard telescope you will see substantial craters Fracastorious Blancanus Zach Planck andmany others familiar to any lunar scientist that would be unknown if they were on our_own oceanfloors We have better maps of Mars than we do of our_own seabeds At the surface level investigative techniques have also been a trifle ad hoc In thirty fourthousand ice hockey gloves were swept overboard from a Korean cargo ship during a storm in thePacific The gloves washed up all over from Vancouver to Vietnam helping oceanographers to tracecurrents more accurately than they ever had before Today Alvin is nearly forty years_old but it still remains America's premier research vessel Thereare still no submersibles that can go anywhere near the depth of the Mariana Trench and only five including Alvin that can reach the depths of the abyssal plain the deep ocean floor that coversmore than half the planet's surface A typical submersible costs about a day to operate sothey are hardly dropped into the water on a whim still less put to sea in the hope that they willrandomly stumble on something of interest It's rather as if our firsthand experience of the surfaceworld were based on the work of five guys exploring on garden tractors after dark According toRobert Kunzig humans may have scrutinized perhaps a millionth or a billionth of the sea's darkness Maybe less Maybe much less But oceanographers are nothing if not industrious and they have made several importantdiscoveries with their limited resources including in one of the most important and startlingbiological discoveries of the twentieth_century In that year Alvin found teeming colonies of largeorganisms living on and around deep sea vents off the Gal pagos Islands tube worms over ten feetlong clams a foot wide shrimps and mussels in profusion wriggling spaghetti worms They all owedtheir existence to vast colonies of bacteria that were deriving their energy and sustenance fromhydrogen sulfides compounds profoundly toxic to surface creatures that were pouring steadilyfrom the vents It was a world independent of sunlight oxygen or anything_else normally associatedwith life This was a living system based not on photosynthesis but on chemosynthesis anarrangement that biologists would have dismissed as preposterous had anyone been imaginativeenough to suggest it Huge amounts of heat and energy flow from these vents Two dozen of them together will produceas much energy as a large power station and the range of temperatures around them is enormous Thetemperature at the point of outflow can be as much as degrees_Fahrenheit while a few feet awaythe water may be only two or three degrees above freezing A type of worm called an alvinellid wasfound living right on the margins with the water temperature degrees warmer at its head than atits tail Before this it had been thought that no complex organisms could survive in water warmer thanabout degrees and here was one that was surviving warmer temperatures than that and extremecold to boot The discovery transformed our_understanding of the requirements for life It also answered one of the great puzzles of oceanography something that many of us didn't realizewas a puzzle namely why the oceans don't grow saltier with time At the risk of stating the obvious there is a lot of salt in the sea enough to bury every bit of land on the planet to a depth of about fivehundred feet Millions of gallons of fresh water evaporate from the ocean daily leaving all their saltsbehind so logically the seas ought to grow more salty with the passing years but they don't Something takes an amount of salt out of the water equivalent to the amount being put in For thelongest time no one could figure out what could be responsible for this Alvin's discovery of the deep sea vents provided the answer Geophysicists realized that the ventswere acting much like the filters in a fish tank As water is taken down into the crust salts arestripped from it and eventually clean water is blown out again through the chimney stacks Theprocess is not swift it can take up to ten million_years to clean an ocean but it is marvelouslyefficient as long as you are not in a hurry Perhaps nothing speaks more clearly of our psychological remoteness from the ocean depths than thatthe main expressed goal for oceanographers during International Geophysical Year of wasto study the use of ocean depths for the dumping of radioactive wastes This wasn't a secretassignment you understand but a proud public boast In_fact though it wasn't much publicized by the dumping of radioactive wastes had already been going on with a certain appallingvigor for over a decade Since the United_States had been ferrying fifty five gallon drums ofradioactive gunk out to the Farallon Islands some thirty miles off the California coast near SanFrancisco where it simply threw them overboard It was all quite extraordinarily sloppy Most of the drums were exactly the sort you see rustingbehind gas stations or standing outside factories with no protective linings of any type When theyfailed to sink which was usually Navy gunners riddled them with bullets to let water in and ofcourse plutonium uranium and strontium out Before it was halted in the s the United Stateshad dumped many hundreds of thousands of drums into about fifty ocean sites almost fifty thousandof them in the Farallons alone But the U_S was by no means alone Among the other enthusiasticdumpers were Russia China Japan New_Zealand and nearly all the nations of Europe And what effect might all this have had on life beneath the seas Well little we hope but weactually have no idea We are astoundingly sumptuously radiantly ignorant of life beneath the seas Even the most substantial ocean creatures are often remarkably little known to us including the mostmighty of them all the great blue whale a creature of such leviathan proportions that to quote DavidAttenborough its tongue weighs as much as an elephant its heart is the size of a car and some of itsblood vessels are so wide that you could swim down them It is the most gargantuan beast that Earthhas yet produced bigger even than the most cumbrous dinosaurs Yet the lives of blue whales arelargely a mystery to us Much of the time we have no idea where they are where they go to breed for_instance or what routes they follow to get there What little we know of them comes almostentirely from eavesdropping on their songs but even these are a mystery Blue whales will sometimesbreak off a song then pick it up again at the same spot six months later Sometimes they strike up witha new song which no member can have heard before but which each already knows How they dothis is not remotely understood And these are animals that must routinely come to the surface tobreathe For animals that need never surface obscurity can be even more tantalizing Consider the fabledgiant squid Though nothing on the scale of the blue whale it is a decidedly substantial animal witheyes the size of soccer balls and trailing tentacles that can reach lengths of sixty feet It weighs nearlya ton and is Earth's largest invertebrate If you dumped one in a normal household swimming pool there wouldn't be much room for anything_else Yet no scientist no person as far as we know hasever seen a giant squid alive Zoologists have devoted careers to trying to capture or just glimpse living giant squid and have always failed They are known mostly from being washed up on beaches particularly for unknown reasons the beaches of the South Island of New_Zealand They must existin large numbers because they form a central part of the sperm whale's diet and sperm whales take alot of feeding According to one estimate there could be as many as thirty million species of animals living in thesea most still undiscovered The first hint of how abundant life is in the deep seas didn't come untilas recently as the s with the invention of the epibenthic sled a dredging device that capturesorganisms not just on and near the seafloor but also buried in the sediments beneath In a single onehour trawl along the continental shelf at a depth of just under a mile Woods Hole oceanographersHoward Sandler and Robert Hessler netted over creatures worms starfish sea cucumbers and the like representing species Even at a depth of three miles they found some creatures representing almost species of organism But the dredge could only capture things thatwere too slow or stupid to get out of the way In the late_s a marine biologist named John Isaacsgot the idea to lower a camera with bait attached to it and found still more in particular denseswarms of writhing hagfish a primitive eel like creature as well as darting shoals of grenadier fish Where a good food source is suddenly available for_instance when a whale dies and sinks to thebottom as many as species of marine creature have been found dining off it Interestingly manyof these creatures were found to have come from vents up to a thousand miles distant These includedsuch types as mussels and clams which are hardly known as great travelers It is now thought that thelarvae of certain organisms may drift through the water until by some unknown chemical means theydetect that they have arrived at a food opportunity and fall onto it So why if the seas are so vast do we so easily overtax them Well to begin with the world's seasare not uniformly bounteous Altogether less than a tenth of the ocean is considered naturallyproductive Most aquatic species like to be in shallow waters where there is warmth and light and anabundance of organic matter to prime the food chain Coral reefs for_instance constitute well under percent of the ocean's space but are home to about percent of its fish Elsewhere the oceans aren't nearly so rich Take Australia With over miles of coastlineand almost nine million square miles of territorial waters it has more sea lapping its shores than anyother country yet as Tim_Flannery notes it doesn't even make it into the top fifty among fishingnations Indeed Australia is a large net importer of seafood This is because much of Australia'swaters are like much of Australia itself essentially desert A notable exception is the Great BarrierReef off Queensland which is sumptuously fecund Because the soil is poor it produces little in theway of nutrient rich runoff Even where life thrives it is often extremely sensitive to disturbance In the s fishermen fromAustralia and to a lesser extent New_Zealand discovered shoals of a little known fish living at adepth of about half a mile on their continental shelves They were known as orange roughy they weredelicious and they existed in huge numbers In no time at all fishing fleets were hauling in fortythousand metric_tons of roughy a year Then marine biologists made some alarming discoveries Roughy are extremely long lived and slow maturing Some may be years_old any roughy youhave eaten may well have been born when Victoria was Queen Roughy have adopted thisexceedingly unhurried lifestyle because the waters they live in are so resource poor In such waters some fish spawn just once in a lifetime Clearly these are populations that cannot stand a great_deal ofdisturbance Unfortunately by the time this was realized the stocks had been severely depleted Evenwith careful management it will be decades before the populations recover if they ever do Elsewhere however the misuse of the oceans has been more wanton than inadvertent Manyfishermen fin sharks that is slice their fins off then dump them back into the water to die In shark fins sold in the Far East for over a pound A bowl of shark fin soup retailed inTokyo for The World Wildlife Fund estimated in that the number of sharks killed eachyear was between million and million As of some industrial sized fishing ships plus about a million smaller boats werebetween them taking twice as many fish from the sea as they had just twenty_five years earlier Trawlers are sometimes now as big as cruise ships and haul behind them nets big enough to hold adozen jumbo jets Some even use spotter planes to locate shoals of fish from the air It is estimated that about a quarter of every fishing net hauled up contains by catch fish thatcan't be landed because they are too small or of the wrong type or caught in the wrong season As oneobserver told the Economist We're still in the Dark Ages We just drop a net down and see whatcomes up Perhaps as much as twenty two million metric_tons of such unwanted fish are dumpedback in the sea each year mostly in the form of corpses For every pound of shrimp harvested aboutfour pounds of fish and other marine creatures are destroyed Large areas of the North Sea floor are dragged clean by beam trawlers as many as seven times ayear a degree of disturbance that no ecosystem can withstand At least two_thirds of species in theNorth Sea by many estimates are being overfished Across the Atlantic things are no better Halibutonce abounded in such numbers off New_England that individual boats could land twenty thousandpounds of it in a day Now halibut is all but extinct off the northeast coast of North_America Nothing however compares with the fate of cod In the late fifteenth century the explorer JohnCabot found cod in incredible numbers on the eastern banks of North_America shallow areas ofwater popular with bottom feeding fish like cod Some of these banks were vast Georges Banks offMassachusetts is bigger_than the state it abuts The Grand Banks off Newfoundland is bigger still andfor centuries was always dense with cod They were thought to be inexhaustible Of_course they wereanything but By the number of spawning cod in the north Atlantic had fallen to an estimated millionmetric tons By this had sunk to metric_tons In commercial terms the cod were extinct Fishermen wrote Mark Kurlansky in his fascinating history Cod had caught them all The codmay have lost the western Atlantic forever In cod fishing was stopped altogether on the GrandBanks but as of last autumn according to a report in Nature stocks had not staged a comeback Kurlansky notes that the fish of fish fillets and fish sticks was originally cod but then was replaced byhaddock then by redfish and lately by Pacific pollock These days he notes drily fish is whatever is left Much the same can be said of many other seafoods In the New_England fisheries off Rhode Island it was once routine to haul in lobsters weighing twenty pounds Sometimes they reached thirty pounds Left unmolested lobsters can live for decades as much as seventy years it is thought and theynever stop growing Nowadays few lobsters weigh more than two pounds on capture Biologists according to the New_York_Times estimate that percent of lobsters are caught within a year afterthey reach the legal minimum size at about age six Despite declining catches New Englandfishermen continue to receive state and federal tax incentives that encourage them in some cases allbut compel them to acquire bigger boats and to harvest the seas more intensively Today fishermenof Massachusetts are reduced to fishing the hideous hagfish for which there is a slight market in theFar East but even their numbers are now falling We are remarkably ignorant of the dynamics that rule life in the sea While marine life is poorerthan it ought to be in areas that have been overfished in some naturally impoverished waters there isfar more life than there ought to be The southern oceans around Antarctica produce only about percent of the world's phytoplankton far too little it would seem to support a complex ecosystem and yet it does Crab eater seals are not a species of animal that most of us have heard of but theymay actually be the second most numerous large species of animal on Earth after humans As many asfifteen million of them may live on the pack ice around Antarctica There are also perhaps twomillion Weddel seals at_least half a million emperor penguins and maybe as many as four millionAd lie penguins The food chain is thus hopelessly top heavy but somehow it works Remarkably noone knows how All this is a very roundabout way of making the point that we know very little about Earth's biggestsystem But then as we shall_see in the pages remaining to us once you start talking_about life thereis a great_deal we_don't_know not least how it got going in the first place THE RISE OF LIFEIN STANLEY Miller a graduate_student at the University of Chicago took two flasks onecontaining a little water to represent a primeval ocean the other holding a mixture of methane ammonia and hydrogen sulphide gases to represent Earth's early atmosphere connected them withrubber tubes and introduced some electrical sparks as a stand in for lightning After a few days thewater in the flasks had turned green and yellow in a hearty broth of amino_acids fatty acids sugars and other organic compounds If God didn't do it this way observed Miller's delighted supervisor the Nobel laureate Harold Urey He missed a good bet Press reports of the time made it sound as if about all that was needed now was for somebody togive the whole a good shake and life would crawl out As time has shown it wasn't nearly so simple Despite half a century of further study we are no nearer to synthesizing life today than we were in and much further away from thinking we can Scientists are now pretty certain that the earlyatmosphere was nothing like as primed for development as Miller and Urey's gaseous stew but ratherwas a much less reactive blend of nitrogen and carbon_dioxide Repeating Miller's experiments withthese more challenging inputs has so far produced only one fairly primitive amino acid At all events creating amino_acids is not really the problem The problem is proteins Proteins are what you get when you string amino_acids together and we need a lot of them No onereally knows but there may be as many as a million types of protein in the human_body and each oneis a little miracle By all the laws of probability proteins shouldn't exist To make a protein you needto assemble amino_acids which I_am obliged by long tradition to refer to here as the building blocksof life in a particular order in much the same way that you assemble letters in a particular order tospell a word The problem is that words in the amino acid alphabet are often exceedingly long Tospell collagen the name of a common type of protein you need to arrange eight letters in the rightorder But to make collagen you need to arrange amino_acids in precisely the right sequence But and here's an obvious but crucial point you don't make it It makes itself spontaneously without direction and this is where the unlikelihoods come in The chances of a sequence molecule like collagen spontaneously self assembling are frankly nil It just isn't going to happen To grasp what a long shot its existence is visualize astandard Las Vegas slot machine but broadened greatly to about ninety feet to be precise toaccommodate spinning wheels instead of the usual three or four and with twenty symbols oneach wheel one for each common amino acid How long would you have to pull the handlebefore all symbols came up in the right order Effectively forever Even if you reduced thenumber of spinning wheels to two hundred which is actually a more typical number of amino acidsfor a protein the odds against all two hundred coming up in a prescribed sequence are in thatis a followed by zeroes That in itself is a larger number than all the atoms in the universe Proteins in short are complex entities Hemoglobin is only amino_acids long a runt by proteinstandards yet even it offers possible amino acid combinations which is why it took theCambridge University chemist Max Perutz twenty three years a career more or less to unravel it For random events to produce even a single protein would seem a stunning improbability like awhirlwind spinning through a junkyard and leaving behind a fully assembled jumbo jet in the colorfulsimile of the astronomer Fred Hoyle Yet we are talking_about several hundred thousand types of protein perhaps a million each uniqueand each as far as we know vital to the maintenance of a sound and happy you And it goes on fromthere A protein to be of use must not only assemble amino_acids in the right sequence but then mustengage in a kind of chemical origami and fold itself into a very specific shape Even having achievedthis structural complexity a protein is no good to you if it can't reproduce itself and proteins can't For this you need DNA DNA is a whiz at replicating it can make a copy of itself in seconds butcan do virtually nothing else So we have a paradoxical situation Proteins can't exist without DNA and DNA has no purpose without proteins Are we to assume then that they arose simultaneously withthe purpose of supporting each other If so wow And there is more still DNA proteins and the other components of life couldn't prosper withoutsome sort of membrane to contain them No atom or molecule has ever achieved life independently Pluck any atom from your_body and it is no more alive than is a grain of sand It is only when theycome together within the nurturing refuge of a cell that these diverse materials can take part in theamazing dance that we call life Without the cell they are nothing more than interesting chemicals Butwithout the chemicals the cell has no purpose As the physicist Paul Davies puts it If everythingneeds everything else how did the community of molecules ever arise in the first place It is ratheras if all the ingredients in your kitchen somehow got together and baked themselves into a cake but acake that could moreover divide when necessary to produce more cakes It is little wonder that wecall it the miracle of life It is also little wonder that we have barely begun to understand it So what accounts for all this wondrous complexity Well one possibility is that perhaps it isn't quite not quite so wondrous as at first it seems Take those amazingly improbable proteins Thewonder we see in their assembly comes in assuming that they arrived on the scene fully formed Butwhat if the protein chains didn't assemble all at once What if in the great slot machine of creation some of the wheels could be held as a gambler might hold a number of promising cherries What if in other words proteins didn't suddenly burst into being but evolved Imagine if you took all the components that make up a human being carbon hydrogen oxygen andso on and put them in a container with some water gave it a vigorous stir and out stepped acompleted person That would be amazing Well that's essentially what Hoyle and others includingmany ardent creationists argue when they suggest that proteins spontaneously formed all at once They didn't they can't have As Richard Dawkins argues in The Blind_Watchmaker there must havebeen some kind of cumulative selection process that allowed amino_acids to assemble in chunks Perhaps two or three amino_acids linked up for some simple purpose and then after a time bumpedinto some other similar small cluster and in so doing discovered some additional improvement Chemical reactions of the sort associated_with life are actually something of a commonplace Itmay be beyond us to cook them up in a lab la Stanley Miller and Harold Urey but the universedoes it readily enough Lots of molecules in nature get together to form long chains called polymers Sugars constantly assemble to form starches Crystals can do a number of lifelike things replicate respond to environmental stimuli take on a patterned complexity They've never achieved life itself of course but they demonstrate repeatedly that complexity is a natural spontaneous entirelycommonplace event There may or may not be a great_deal of life in the universe at large but there isno shortage of ordered self assembly in everything from the transfixing symmetry of snowflakes tothe comely rings of Saturn So powerful is this natural impulse to assemble that many scientists now believe that life may bemore inevitable than we think that it is in the words of the Belgian biochemist and Nobel laureateChristian de_Duve an obligatory manifestation of matter bound to arise wherever conditions areappropriate De_Duve thought it likely that such conditions would be encountered perhaps a milliontimes in every galaxy Certainly there is nothing terribly exotic in the chemicals that animate us If you wished to createanother living object whether a goldfish or a head of lettuce or a human being you would need reallyonly four principal elements carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen plus small amounts of a fewothers principally sulfur phosphorus calcium and iron Put these together in three dozen or socombinations to form some sugars acids and other basic compounds and you can build anything thatlives As Dawkins notes There is nothing special about the substances from which living_things aremade Living things are collections of molecules like everything else The bottom line is that life is amazing and gratifying perhaps even miraculous but hardlyimpossible as we repeatedly attest with our_own modest existences To be sure many of the detailsof life's beginnings remain pretty imponderable Every scenario you have ever read concerning theconditions necessary for life involves water from the warm little pond where Darwin supposedlife began to the bubbling sea vents that are now the most popular candidates for life's beginnings but all this overlooks the fact that to turn monomers into polymers which is to say to begin to createproteins involves what is known to biology as dehydration linkages As one leading biology textputs it with perhaps just a tiny hint of discomfort Researchers agree that such reactions would nothave been energetically favorable in the primitive sea or indeed in any aqueous medium because ofthe mass action law It is a little like putting sugar in a glass of water and having it become a cube Itshouldn't happen but somehow in nature it does The actual chemistry of all this is a little arcane forour purposes here but it is enough to know that if you make monomers wet they don't turn intopolymers except when creating life on Earth How and why it happens then and not otherwise is oneof biology's great unanswered questions One of the biggest surprises in the earth sciences in recent decades was the discovery of just howearly in Earth's history life arose Well into the s it was thought that life was less than million_years old By the s a few adventurous souls felt that maybe it went back billionyears But the present date of billion years is stunningly early Earth's surface didn't becomesolid until about billion_years_ago We can only infer from this rapidity that it is not difficult' for life of bacterial grade to evolve onplanets with appropriate conditions Stephen_Jay Gould observed in the New_York_Times in Oras he put it elsewhere it is hard to avoid the conclusion that life arising as soon as it could waschemically destined to be Life emerged so swiftly in fact that some authorities think it must have had help perhaps a gooddeal of help The idea that earthly life might have arrived from space has a surprisingly long and evenoccasionally distinguished history The great Lord Kelvin himself raised the possibility as long agoas at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when he suggestedthat the germs of life might have been brought to the earth by some meteorite But it remained littlemore than a fringe notion until one Sunday in September when tens of thousands of Australianswere startled by a series of sonic booms and the sight of a fireball streaking from east to west acrossthe sky The fireball made a strange crackling sound as it passed and left_behind a smell that somelikened to methylated spirits and others described as just awful The fireball exploded above Murchison a town of six hundred people in the Goulburn Valley northof Melbourne and came raining down in chunks some weighing up to twelve pounds Fortunately noone was hurt The meteorite was of a rare type known as a carbonaceous chondrite and thetownspeople helpfully collected and brought in some two hundred pounds of it The timing couldhardly have been better Less than two months earlier the Apollo astronauts had returned to Earthwith a bag full of lunar rocks so labs throughout the world were geared up indeed clamoring forrocks of extraterrestrial origin The Murchison meteorite was found to be billion years_old and it was studded with aminoacids seventy four types in all eight of which are involved in the formation of earthly proteins Inlate more than thirty years after it crashed a team at the Ames Research Center in Californiaannounced that the Murchison rock also contained complex strings of sugars called polyols whichhad not been found off the Earth before A few other carbonaceous chondrites have strayed into Earth's path since one that landed nearTagish Lake in Canada's Yukon in January was seen over large parts of North_America andthey have likewise confirmed that the universe is actually rich in organic compounds Halley's comet it is now thought is about percent organic molecules Get enough of those crashing into a suitableplace Earth for_instance and you have the basic elements you need for life There are two problems with notions of panspermia as extraterrestrial theories are known Thefirst is that it doesn't answer any questions about how life arose but merely moves responsibility forit elsewhere The other is that panspermia sometimes excites even the most respectable adherents tolevels of speculation that can be safely called imprudent Francis Crick codiscoverer of the structureof DNA and his colleague Leslie Orgel have suggested that Earth was deliberately seeded with lifeby intelligent aliens an idea that Gribbin calls at the very fringe of scientific respectability or put another way a notion that would be considered wildly lunatic if not voiced by a Nobel laureate Fred Hoyle and his colleague Chandra Wickramasinghe further eroded enthusiasm for panspermia bysuggesting that outer space brought us not only life but also many diseases such as flu and bubonicplague ideas that were easily disproved by biochemists Hoyle and it seems necessary to insert areminder here that he was one of the great scientific minds of the twentieth_century also oncesuggested as mentioned earlier that our noses evolved with the nostrils underneath as a way ofkeeping cosmic pathogens from falling into them as they drifted down from space Whatever prompted life to begin it happened just once That is the most extraordinary fact inbiology perhaps the most extraordinary fact we know Everything that has ever lived plant or animal dates its beginnings from the same primordial twitch At some point in an unimaginably distant pastsome little bag of chemicals fidgeted to life It absorbed some nutrients gently pulsed had a briefexistence This much may have happened before perhaps many times But this ancestral packet didsomething additional and extraordinary it cleaved itself and produced an heir A tiny bundle ofgenetic material passed from one living entity to another and has never stopped moving since It wasthe moment of creation for us all Biologists sometimes call it the Big Birth Wherever you go in the world whatever animal plant bug or blob you look at if it is alive itwill use the same dictionary and know the same code All life is one says Matt Ridley We are allthe result of a single genetic trick handed down from generation to generation nearly four billionyears to such an extent that you can take a fragment of human genetic instruction patch it into a faultyyeast cell and the yeast cell will put it to work as if it were its own In a very real sense it is itsown The dawn of life or something very like it sits on a shelf in the office of a friendly isotopegeochemist named Victoria Bennett in the Earth Sciences building of the Australian NationalUniversity in Canberra An American Ms Bennett came to the ANU from California on a two yearcontract in and has been there ever_since When I visited her in late she handed me amodestly hefty hunk of rock composed of thin alternating stripes of white quartz and a gray greenmaterial called clinopyroxene The rock came from Akilia Island in Greenland where unusuallyancient rocks were found in The rocks are billion years_old and represent the oldestmarine sediments ever found We can't be certain that what you are holding once contained living organisms because you'd haveto pulverize it to find out Bennett told_me But it comes from the same deposit where the oldest lifewas excavated so it probably had life in it Nor would you find actual fossilized microbes however carefully you searched Any simple organisms alas would have been baked away by theprocesses that turned ocean mud to stone Instead what we would see if we crunched up the rock andexamined it microscopically would be the chemical residues that the organisms left_behind carbonisotopes and a type of phosphate called apatite which together provide strong evidence that the rockonce contained colonies of living_things We can only guess what the organism might have lookedlike Bennett said It was probably about as basic as life can get but it was life nonetheless Itlived It propagated And eventually it led to us If you are into very old rocks and Bennett indubitably is the ANU has long been a prime place tobe This is largely thanks to the ingenuity of a man named Bill Compston who is now retired but inthe s built the world's first Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro Probe or SHRIMP as it ismore affectionately known from its initial letters This is a machine that measures the decay rate ofuranium in tiny minerals called zircons Zircons appear in most rocks apart from basalts and areextremely durable surviving every natural process but subduction Most of the Earth's_crust has beenslipped back into the oven at some point but just occasionally in Western Australia and Greenland for example geologists have found outcrops of rocks that have remained always at the surface Compston's machine allowed such rocks to be dated with unparalleled precision The prototypeSHRIMP was built and machined in the Earth Science department's own workshops and looked likesomething that had been built from spare parts on a budget but it worked great On its first formaltest in it dated the oldest thing ever found a billion year old rock from WesternAustralia It caused quite a stir at the time Bennett told_me to find something so important so quickly withbrand new technology She took me down the hall to see the current model SHRIMP II It was a big heavy piece ofstainless steel apparatus perhaps twelve feet long and five feet high and as solidly built as a deepsea probe At a console in front of it keeping an eye on ever changing strings of figures on a screen was a man named Bob from Canterbury University in New_Zealand He had been there since A M he told_me SHRIMP II runs twenty four hours a day there's that many rocks to date It was just after A M and Bob had the machine till noon Ask a pair of geochemists how something like this works andthey will start talking_about isotopic abundances and ionization levels with an enthusiasm that is moreendearing than fathomable The upshot of it however was that the machine by bombarding a sampleof rock with streams of charged atoms is able to detect subtle differences in the amounts of lead anduranium in the zircon samples by which means the age of rocks can be accurately adduced Bob toldme that it takes about seventeen minutes to read one zircon and it is necessary to read dozens fromeach rock to make the data reliable In practice the process seemed to involve about the same levelof scattered activity and about as much stimulation as a trip to a laundromat Bob seemed veryhappy however but then people from New_Zealand very generally do The Earth Sciences compound was an odd combination of things part offices part labs partmachine shed We used to build everything here Bennett said We even had our_own glassblower but he's retired But we still have two full time rock crushers She caught my look of mild surprise We get through a lot of rocks And they have to be very carefully prepared You have to make surethere is no contamination from previous samples no dust or anything It's quite a meticulousprocess She showed me the rock crushing machines which were indeed pristine though the rockcrushers had apparently gone for coffee Beside the machines were large boxes containing rocks ofall shapes and sizes They do indeed get through a lot of rocks at the ANU Back in Bennett's office after our tour I noticed hanging on her wall a poster giving an artist'scolorfully imaginative interpretation of Earth as it might have looked billion_years_ago just whenlife was getting going in the ancient period known to earth science as the Archaean The postershowed an alien landscape of huge very active volcanoes and a steamy copper colored sea beneatha harsh red sky Stromatolites a kind of bacterial rock filled the shallows in the foreground It didn'tlook like a very promising place to create and nurture life I_asked her if the painting was accurate Well one school of thought says it was actually cool then because the sun was much weaker Ilater learned that biologists when they are feeling jocose refer to this as the Chinese restaurantproblem because we had a dim sun Without an atmosphere ultraviolet rays from the sun evenfrom a weak sun would have tended to break apart any incipient bonds made by molecules And yetright there she tapped the stromatolites you have organisms almost at the surface It's a puzzle So we_don't_know what the world was like back then Mmmm she agreed thoughtfully Either way it doesn't seem very conducive to life She nodded amiably But there must have been something that suited life Otherwise we wouldn'tbe here It certainly wouldn't have suited us If you were to step from a time machine into that ancientArchaean world you would very swiftly scamper back inside for there was no more oxygen tobreathe on Earth back then than there is on Mars today It was also full of noxious vapors fromhydrochloric and sulfuric acids powerful enough to eat through clothing and blister skin Nor would ithave provided the clean and glowing vistas depicted in the poster in Victoria Bennett's office Thechemical stew that was the atmosphere then would have allowed little sunlight to reach the Earth'ssurface What little you could see would be illumined only briefly by bright and frequent lightningflashes In short it was Earth but an Earth we wouldn't recognize as our_own Anniversaries were few and far between in the Archaean world For two billion years bacterialorganisms were the only forms of life They lived they reproduced they swarmed but they didn'tshow any particular inclination to move on to another more challenging level of existence At somepoint in the first billion years of life cyanobacteria or blue green algae learned to tap into a freelyavailable resource the hydrogen that exists in spectacular abundance in water They absorbed watermolecules supped on the hydrogen and released the oxygen as waste and in so doing inventedphotosynthesis As Margulis and Sagan note photosynthesis is undoubtedly the most important singlemetabolic innovation in the history of life on the planet and it was invented not by plants but bybacteria As cyanobacteria proliferated the world began to fill with O to the consternation of thoseorganisms that found it poisonous which in those days was all of them In an anaerobic or a nonoxygen using world oxygen is extremely poisonous Our white cells actually use oxygen to killinvading bacteria That oxygen is fundamentally toxic often comes as a surprise to those of us whofind it so convivial to our well being but that is only because we have evolved to exploit it To otherthings it is a terror It is what turns butter rancid and makes iron rust Even we can tolerate it only upto a point The oxygen level in our cells is only about a tenth the level found in the atmosphere The new oxygen using organisms had two advantages Oxygen was a more efficient way to produceenergy and it vanquished competitor organisms Some retreated into the oozy anaerobic world ofbogs and lake bottoms Others did likewise but then later much later migrated to the digestive tractsof beings like you and me Quite a number of these primeval entities are alive inside your_body rightnow helping to digest your food but abhorring even the tiniest hint of O Untold numbers of othersfailed to adapt and died The cyanobacteria were a runaway success At first the extra oxygen they produced didn'taccumulate in the atmosphere but combined with iron to form ferric oxides which sank to the bottomof primitive seas For millions of years the world literally rusted a phenomenon vividly recordedin the banded iron deposits that provide so much of the world's iron ore today For many tens ofmillions of years not a great_deal more than this happened If you went back to that early Proterozoicworld you wouldn't find many signs of promise for Earth's future life Perhaps here and there insheltered pools you'd encounter a film of living scum or a coating of glossy greens and browns onshoreline rocks but otherwise life remained invisible But about billion_years_ago something more emphatic became apparent Wherever the seaswere shallow visible structures began to appear As they went through their chemical routines thecyanobacteria became very slightly tacky and that tackiness trapped microparticles of dust and sand which became bound together to form slightly weird but solid structures the stromatolites that werefeatured in the shallows of the poster on Victoria Bennett's office wall Stromatolites came in variousshapes and sizes Sometimes they looked like enormous cauliflowers sometimes like fluffymattresses stromatolite comes from the Greek for mattress sometimes they came in the form ofcolumns rising tens of meters above the surface of the water sometimes as high as a hundredmeters In all their manifestations they were a kind of living rock and they represented the world'sfirst cooperative venture with some varieties of primitive organism living just at the surface andothers living just underneath each taking advantage of conditions created by the other The world hadits first ecosystem For many years scientists knew about stromatolites from fossil formations but in they got areal surprise with the discovery of a community of living stromatolites at Shark Bay on the remotenorthwest coast of Australia This was most unexpected so unexpected in fact that it was someyears before scientists realized quite what they had found Today however Shark Bay is a touristattraction or at_least as much of a tourist attraction as a place hundreds of miles from anywheremuch and dozens of miles from anywhere at all can ever be Boardwalks have been built out into thebay so that visitors can stroll over the water to get a good look at the stromatolites quietly respiringjust beneath the surface They are lusterless and gray and look as I recorded in an earlier book likevery large cow pats But it is a curiously giddying moment to find yourself staring at living remnantsof Earth as it was billion_years_ago As Richard_Fortey has put it This is truly time traveling and if the world were attuned to its real wonders this sight would be as well known as the pyramidsof Giza Although you'd never guess it these dull rocks swarm with life with an estimated well obviously estimated three billion individual organisms on every square yard of rock Sometimeswhen you look carefully you can see tiny strings of bubbles rising to the surface as they give up theiroxygen In two billion years such tiny exertions raised the level of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere to percent preparing the way for the next more complex chapter in life's history It has been suggested that the cyanobacteria at Shark Bay are perhaps the slowest evolvingorganisms on Earth and certainly now they are among the rarest Having prepared the way for morecomplex life forms they were then grazed out of existence nearly everywhere by the very organismswhose existence they had made possible They exist at Shark Bay because the waters are too salinefor the creatures that would normally feast on them One reason life took so long to grow complex was that the world had to wait until the simplerorganisms had oxygenated the atmosphere sufficiently Animals could not summon up the energy towork as Fortey has put it It took about two billion years roughly percent of Earth's history foroxygen levels to reach more or less modern levels of concentration in the atmosphere But once thestage was set and apparently quite suddenly an entirely new type of cell arose one with a nucleusand other little bodies collectively called organelles from a Greek_word meaning little tools Theprocess is thought to have started when some blundering or adventuresome bacterium either invadedor was captured by some other bacterium and it turned_out that this suited them both The captivebacterium became it is thought a mitochondrion This mitochondrial invasion or endosymbioticevent as biologists like to term it made complex life possible In plants a similar invasion producedchloroplasts which enable plants to photosynthesize Mitochondria manipulate oxygen in a way that liberates energy from foodstuffs Without this niftilyfacilitating trick life on Earth today would be nothing more than a sludge of simple microbes Mitochondria are very tiny you could pack a billion into the space occupied by a grain of sand butalso very hungry Almost every nutriment you absorb goes to feeding them We couldn't live for two minutes without them yet even after a billion years mitochondria behaveas if they think things might not work out between us They maintain their own DNA They reproduceat a different time from their host cell They look like bacteria divide like bacteria and sometimesrespond to antibiotics in the way bacteria do In short they keep their bags packed They don't evenspeak the same genetic language as the cell in which they live It is like having a stranger in yourhouse but one who has been there for a billion years The new type of cell is known as a eukaryote meaning truly nucleated as contrasted with theold type which is known as a prokaryote prenucleated and it seems to have arrived suddenly inthe fossil_record The oldest eukaryotes yet known called Grypania were discovered in ironsediments in Michigan in Such fossils have been found just once and then no more are knownfor million_years Compared with the new eukaryotes the old prokaryotes were little more than bags of chemicals in the words of the geologist Stephen Drury Eukaryotes were bigger eventually as much as tenthousand times bigger_than their simpler cousins and carried as much as a thousand times moreDNA Gradually a system evolved in which life was dominated by two types of form organisms thatexpel oxygen like plants and those that take it in you and me Single celled eukaryotes were once called protozoa pre animals but that term is increasinglydisdained Today the common term for them is protists Compared with the bacteria that had gonebefore these new protists were wonders of design and sophistication The simple amoeba just onecell big and without any ambitions but to exist contains million bits of genetic information in itsDNA enough as Carl Sagan noted to fill eighty books of five hundred pages Eventually the eukaryotes learned an even more singular trick It took a long time a billion yearsor so but it was a good one when they mastered it They learned to form together into complexmulticellular beings Thanks to this innovation big complicated visible entities like us werepossible Planet Earth was ready to move on to its next ambitious phase But before we get too excited about that it is worth remembering that the world as we are about tosee still belongs to the very small SMALL WORLDIT'S PROBABLY NOT a good idea to take too personal an interest in your microbes Louis Pasteur the great French chemist and bacteriologist became so preoccupied with them that he took to peeringcritically at every dish placed before him with a magnifying glass a habit that presumably did not winhim many repeat invitations to dinner In_fact there is no point in trying to hide from your bacteria for they are on and around you always in numbers you can't conceive If you are in good health and averagely diligent about hygiene youwill have a herd of about one trillion bacteria grazing on your fleshy plains about a hundredthousand of them on every square centimeter of skin They are there to dine off the ten billion or soflakes of skin you shed every day plus all the tasty oils and fortifying minerals that seep out fromevery pore and fissure You are for them the ultimate food court with the convenience of warmth andconstant mobility thrown in By way of thanks they give you B O And those are just the bacteria that inhabit your skin There are trillions more tucked away in yourgut and nasal passages clinging to your hair and eyelashes swimming over the surface of your eyes drilling through the enamel of your teeth Your digestive system alone is host to more than a hundredtrillion microbes of at_least four_hundred types Some deal with sugars some with starches someattack other bacteria A surprising number like the ubiquitous intestinal spirochetes have nodetectable function at all They just seem to like to be with you Every human_body consists of about quadrillion cells but about quadrillion bacterial cells They are in short a big part of us From the bacteria's point of view of course we are a rather small part of them Because we humans are big and clever enough to produce and utilize antibiotics and disinfectants it is easy to convince ourselves that we have banished bacteria to the fringes of existence Don't youbelieve it Bacteria may not build cities or have interesting social lives but they will be here whenthe Sun explodes This is their planet and we are on it only because they allow us to be Bacteria never forget got along for billions of years without us We couldn't survive a day withoutthem They process our wastes and make them usable again without their diligent munching nothingwould rot They purify our water and keep our soils productive Bacteria synthesize vitamins in ourgut convert the things we eat into useful sugars and polysaccharides and go to war on alien microbesthat slip down our gullet We depend totally on bacteria to pluck nitrogen from the air and convert it into useful nucleotidesand amino_acids for us It is a prodigious and gratifying feat As Margulis and Sagan note to do thesame thing industrially as when making fertilizers manufacturers must heat the source materials to degrees centigrade and squeeze them to three hundred times normal pressures Bacteria do it allthe time without fuss and thank goodness for no larger organism could survive without the nitrogenthey pass on Above_all microbes continue to provide us with the air we breathe and to keep theatmosphere stable Microbes including the modern versions of cyanobacteria supply the greater partof the planet's breathable oxygen Algae and other tiny organisms bubbling away in the sea blow outabout billion kilos of the stuff every year And they are amazingly prolific The more frantic among them can yield a new generation in lessthan ten minutes Clostridium perfringens the disagreeable little organism that causes gangrene canreproduce in nine minutes At such a rate a single bacterium could theoretically produce moreoffspring in two days than there are protons in the universe Given an adequate supply of nutrients asingle bacterial cell can generate billion individuals in a single day according to theBelgian biochemist and Nobel laureate Christian de_Duve In the same period a human cell can justabout manage a single division About once every million divisions they produce a mutant Usually this is bad luck for the mutant change is always risky for an organism but just occasionally the new bacterium is endowed withsome accidental advantage such as the ability to elude or shrug off an attack of antibiotics With thisability to evolve rapidly goes another even scarier advantage Bacteria share information Anybacterium can take pieces of genetic coding from any other Essentially as Margulis and Sagan put it all bacteria swim in a single gene pool Any adaptive change that occurs in one area of the bacterialuniverse can spread to any other It's rather as if a human could go to an insect to get the necessarygenetic coding to sprout wings or walk on ceilings It means that from a genetic point of view bacteriahave become a single superorganism tiny dispersed but invincible They will live and thrive on almost anything you spill dribble or shake loose Just give them alittle moisture as when you run a damp cloth over a counter and they will bloom as if created fromnothing They will eat wood the glue in wallpaper the metals in hardened paint Scientists inAustralia found microbes known as Thiobacillus concretivorans that lived in indeed could notlive without concentrations of sulfuric acid strong enough to dissolve metal A species calledMicrococcus radiophilus was found living happily in the waste tanks of nuclear reactors gorgingitself on plutonium and whatever else was there Some bacteria break down chemical materials fromwhich as far as we can tell they gain no benefit at all They have been found living in boiling mud pots and lakes of caustic soda deep inside rocks at thebottom of the sea in hidden pools of icy water in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica and sevenmiles down in the Pacific Ocean where pressures are more than a thousand times greater than at thesurface or equivalent to being squashed beneath fifty jumbo jets Some of them seem to be practicallyindestructible Deinococcus radiodurans is according to the Economist almost immune toradioactivity Blast its DNA with radiation and the pieces immediately reform like the scuttlinglimbs of an undead creature from a horror movie Perhaps the most extraordinary survival yet found was that of a Streptococcus bacterium that wasrecovered from the sealed lens of a camera that had stood on the Moon for two years In short thereare few environments in which bacteria aren't prepared to live They are finding now that when theypush probes into ocean vents so hot that the probes actually start to melt there are bacteria eventhere Victoria Bennett told_me In the s two scientists at the University of Chicago Edson Bastin and Frank Greer announcedthat they had isolated from oil wells strains of bacteria that had been living at depths of two thousandfeet The notion was dismissed as fundamentally preposterous there was nothing to live on at twothousand feet and for fifty years it was assumed that their samples had been contaminated withsurface microbes We now know that there are a lot of microbes living deep within the Earth many ofwhich have nothing at all to do with the organic world They eat rocks or rather the stuff that's inrocks iron sulfur manganese and so on And they breathe odd things too iron chromium cobalt even uranium Such processes may be instrumental in concentrating gold copper and other preciousmetals and possibly deposits of oil and natural gas It has even been suggested that their tirelessnibblings created the Earth's_crust Some scientists now think that there could be as much as trillion tons of bacteria living beneathour feet in what are known as subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystems SLiME for short Thomas Gold of Cornell has estimated that if you took all the bacteria out of the Earth's interior anddumped it on the surface it would cover the planet to a depth of five feet If the estimates are correct there could be more life under the Earth than on top of it At depth microbes shrink in size and become extremely sluggish The liveliest of them may divideno more than once a century some no more than perhaps once in five hundred years As theEconomist has put it The key to long life it seems is not to do too much When things are reallytough bacteria are prepared to shut down all systems and wait for better times In scientistssuccessfully activated some anthrax spores that had lain dormant for eighty years in a museum displayin Trondheim Norway Other microorganisms have leapt back to life after being released from a year old can of meat and a year old bottle of beer In scientists at the RussianAcademy of Science claimed to have revived bacteria frozen in Siberian permafrost for three millionyears But the record claim for durability so far is one made by Russell Vreeland and colleagues atWest Chester University in Pennsylvania in when they announced that they had resuscitated million year old bacteria called Bacillus permians that had been trapped in salt deposits twothousand feet underground in Carlsbad New Mexico If so this microbe is older than the continents The report met with some understandable dubiousness Many biochemists maintained that oversuch a span the microbe's components would have become uselessly degraded unless the bacteriumroused itself from time to time However if the bacterium did stir occasionally there was noplausible internal source of energy that could have lasted so long The more doubtful scientistssuggested that the sample may have been contaminated if not during its retrieval then perhaps whilestill buried In a team from Tel Aviv University argued that B permians were almost identicalto a strain of modern bacteria Bacillus marismortui found in the Dead Sea Only two of its geneticsequences differed and then only slightly Are we to believe the Israeli researchers wrote that in million_years B permians hasaccumulated the same amount of genetic differences that could be achieved in just days in thelaboratory In reply Vreeland suggested that bacteria evolve faster in the lab than they do in thewild Maybe It is a remarkable fact that well into the space age most school textbooks divided the world of theliving into just two categories plant and animal Microorganisms hardly featured Amoebas andsimilar single celled organisms were treated as proto animals and algae as proto plants Bacteriawere usually lumped in with plants too even though everyone knew they didn't belong there As farback as the late nineteenth_century the German naturalist Ernst Haeckel had suggested that bacteriadeserved to be placed in a separate kingdom which he called Monera but the idea didn't begin tocatch on among biologists until the s and then only among some of them I note that my trustyAmerican Heritage desk dictionary from doesn't recognize the term Many organisms in the visible world were also poorly served by the traditional division Fungi the group that includes mushrooms molds mildews yeasts and puffballs were nearly always treatedas botanical objects though in fact almost nothing about them how they reproduce and respire howthey build themselves matches anything in the plant world Structurally they have more in commonwith animals in that they build their cells from chitin a material that gives them their distinctivetexture The same substance is used to make the shells of insects and the claws of mammals though itisn't nearly so tasty in a stag beetle as in a Portobello mushroom Above_all unlike all plants fungidon't photosynthesize so they have no chlorophyll and thus are not green Instead they grow directlyon their food source which can be almost anything Fungi will eat the sulfur off a concrete wall or thedecaying matter between your toes two things no plant will do Almost the only plantlike qualitythey have is that they root Even less comfortably susceptible to categorization was the peculiar group of organisms formallycalled myxomycetes but more commonly known as slime molds The name no doubt has much to dowith their obscurity An appellation that sounded a little more dynamic ambulant self activatingprotoplasm say and less like the stuff you find when you reach deep into a clogged drain wouldalmost certainly have earned these extraordinary entities a more immediate share of the attention theydeserve for slime molds are make no mistake among the most interesting organisms in nature Whentimes are good they exist as one celled individuals much like amoebas But when conditions growtough they crawl to a central gathering place and become almost miraculously a slug The slug is nota thing of beauty and it doesn't go terribly far usually just from the bottom of a pile of leaf litter tothe top where it is in a slightly more exposed position but for millions of years this may well havebeen the niftiest trick in the universe And it doesn't stop there Having hauled itself up to a more favorable locale the slime moldtransforms itself yet again taking on the form of a plant By some curious orderly process the cellsreconfigure like the members of a tiny marching band to make a stalk atop of which forms a bulbknown as a fruiting body Inside the fruiting body are millions of spores that at the appropriatemoment are released to the wind to blow away and become single celled organisms that can start theprocess again For years slime molds were claimed as protozoa by zoologists and as fungi by mycologists thoughmost people could see they didn't really belong anywhere When genetic testing arrived people in labcoats were surprised to find that slime molds were so distinctive and peculiar that they weren'tdirectly related to anything_else in nature and sometimes not even to each other In in an attempt to bring some order to the growing inadequacies of classification anecologist from Cornell University named R H Whittaker unveiled in the journal Science a proposalto divide life into five principal branches kingdoms as they are known called Animalia Plantae Fungi Protista and Monera Protista was a modification of an earlier term Protoctista which hadbeen suggested a century earlier by a Scottish biologist named John Hogg and was meant to describeany organisms that were neither plant nor animal Though Whittaker's new scheme was a great improvement Protista remained ill defined Sometaxonomists reserved it for large unicellular organisms the eukaryotes but others treated it as thekind of odd sock drawer of biology putting into it anything that didn't fit anywhere else It included depending on which text you consulted slime molds amoebas and even seaweed among much else By one calculation it contained as many as different species of organism all told That's a lotof odd socks Ironically just as Whittaker's five kingdom classification was beginning to find its way intotextbooks a retiring academic at the University of Illinois was groping his way toward a discoverythat would challenge everything His name was Carl Woese rhymes with rose and since the mid_s or about as early as it was possible to do so he had been quietly studying genetic sequencesin bacteria In the early days this was an exceedingly painstaking process Work on a singlebacterium could easily consume a year At that time according to Woese only about species ofbacteria were known which is fewer than the number of species you have in your mouth Today thenumber is about ten times that though that is still far short of the species of algae offungi and of amoebas and related organisms whose biographies fill the annals of biology It isn't simple indifference that keeps the total low Bacteria can be exasperatingly difficult toisolate and study Only about percent will grow in culture Considering how wildly adaptable theyare in nature it is an odd fact that the one place they seem not to wish to live is a petri dish Plopthem on a bed of agar and pamper them as you will and most will just lie there declining everyinducement to bloom Any bacterium that thrives in a lab is by definition exceptional and yet thesewere almost exclusively the organisms studied by microbiologists It was said Woese likelearning about animals from visiting zoos Genes however allowed Woese to approach microorganisms from another angle As he worked Woese realized that there were more fundamental divisions in the microbial world than anyonesuspected A lot of little organisms that looked like bacteria and behaved like bacteria were actuallysomething else altogether something that had branched off from bacteria a long time ago Woesecalled these organisms archaebacteria later shortened to archaea It has be said that the attributes that distinguish archaea from bacteria are not the sort that wouldquicken the pulse of any but a biologist They are mostly differences in their lipids and an absence ofsomething called peptidoglycan But in practice they make a world of difference Archaeans are moredifferent from bacteria than you and I are from a crab or spider Singlehandedly Woese haddiscovered an unsuspected division of life so fundamental that it stood above the level of kingdom atthe apogee of the Universal Tree of Life as it is rather reverentially known In he startled the world or at_least the little bit of it that was paying attention byredrawing the tree of life to incorporate not five main divisions but twenty three These he groupedunder three new principal categories Bacteria Archaea and Eukarya sometimes spelled Eucarya which he called domains Woese's new divisions did not take the biological world by storm Some dismissed them as muchtoo heavily weighted toward the microbial Many just ignored them Woese according to FrancesAshcroft felt bitterly disappointed But slowly his new scheme began to catch on amongmicrobiologists Botanists and zoologists were much slower to admire its virtues It's not hard to seewhy On Woese's model the worlds of botany and zoology are relegated to a few twigs on theoutermost branch of the Eukaryan limb Everything else belongs to unicellular beings These folks were brought up to classify in terms of gross morphological similarities anddifferences Woese told an interviewer in The idea of doing so in terms of molecularsequence is a bit hard for many of them to swallow In short if they couldn't see a difference withtheir own eyes they didn't like it And so they persisted with the traditional five kingdom division an arrangement that Woese called not very useful in his milder moments and positivelymisleading much of the rest of the time Biology like physics before it Woese wrote has movedto a level where the objects of interest and their interactions often cannot be perceived through directobservation In the great and ancient Harvard zoologist Ernst Mayr who then was in his ninety fourth yearand at the time of my writing is nearing one hundred and still going strong stirred the pot further bydeclaring that there should be just two prime divisions of life empires he called them In a paperpublished in the Proceedings of the National_Academy of Sciences Mayr said that Woese's findingswere interesting but ultimately misguided noting that Woese was not trained as a biologist and quitenaturally does not have an extensive familiarity with the principles of classification which isperhaps as close as one distinguished scientist can come to saying of another that he doesn't knowwhat he is talking_about The specifics of Mayr's criticisms are too technical to need extensive airing here they involveissues of meiotic sexuality Hennigian cladification and controversial interpretations of the genomeof Methanobacterium thermoautrophicum among rather a lot else but essentially he argues thatWoese's arrangement unbalances the tree of life The bacterial realm Mayr notes consists of no morethan a few thousand species while the archaean has a mere named specimens with perhaps a fewthousand more to be found but hardly more than that By contrast the eukaryotic realm that is the complicated organisms with nucleated cells like us numbers already in the millions For thesake of the principle of balance Mayr argues for combining the simple bacterial organisms in asingle category Prokaryota while placing the more complex and highly evolved remainder in theempire Eukaryota which would stand alongside as an equal Put another way he argues for keepingthings much as they were before This division between simple cells and complex cells is where thegreat break is in the living world The distinction between halophilic archaeans and methanosarcina or between flavobacteria andgram positive bacteria clearly will never be a matter of moment for most of us but it is worthremembering that each is as different from its neighbors as animals are from plants If Woese's newarrangement teaches us anything it is that life really is various and that most of that variety is small unicellular and unfamiliar It is a natural human impulse to think of evolution as a long chain ofimprovements of a never ending advance toward largeness and complexity in a word toward us We flatter ourselves Most of the real diversity in evolution has been small scale We large things arejust flukes an interesting side branch Of the twenty three main divisions of life only three plants animals and fungi are large enough to be seen by the human eye and even they contain species thatare microscopic Indeed according to Woese if you totaled up all the biomass of the planet everyliving thing plants included microbes would account for at_least percent of all there is perhapsmore The world belongs to the very small and it has for a very long time So why you are bound to ask at some point in your life do microbes so often want to hurt us Whatpossible satisfaction could there be to a microbe in having us grow feverish or chilled or disfiguredwith sores or above all expire A dead host after all is hardly going to provide long termhospitality To begin with it is worth remembering that most microorganisms are neutral or even beneficial tohuman well being The most rampantly infectious organism on Earth a bacterium called Wolbachia doesn't hurt humans at all or come to that any other vertebrates but if you are a shrimp or wormor fruit fly it can make you wish you had never been born Altogether only about one microbe in athousand is a pathogen for humans according to National_Geographic though knowing what someof them can do we could be forgiven for thinking that that is quite enough Even if mostly benign microbes are still the number three killer in the Western world and even many less lethal ones ofcourse make us deeply rue their existence Making a host unwell has certain benefits for the microbe The symptoms of an illness often help tospread the disease Vomiting sneezing and diarrhea are excellent methods of getting out of one hostand into position for another The most effective strategy of all is to enlist the help of a mobile thirdparty Infectious organisms love mosquitoes because the mosquito's sting delivers them directly to abloodstream where they can get straight to work before the victim's defense mechanisms can figureout what's hit them This is why so many grade A diseases malaria yellow fever dengue fever encephalitis and a hundred or so other less celebrated but often rapacious maladies begin with amosquito bite It is a fortunate fluke for us that HIV the AIDS agent isn't among them at_least notyet Any HIV the mosquito sucks up on its travels is dissolved by the mosquito's own metabolism When the day comes that the virus mutates its way around this we may be in real trouble It is a mistake however to consider the matter too carefully from the position of logic becausemicroorganisms clearly are not calculating entities They don't care what they do to you any more thanyou care what distress you cause when you slaughter them by the millions with a soapy shower or aswipe of deodorant The only time your continuing well being is of consequence to a pathogen iswhen it kills you too well If they eliminate you before they can move on then they may well die outthemselves This in fact sometimes happens History Jared Diamond notes is full of diseases that once caused terrifying epidemics and then disappeared as mysteriously as they had come He citesthe robust but mercifully transient English sweating sickness which raged from to killingtens of thousands as it went before burning itself out Too much efficiency is not a good thing for anyinfectious organism A great_deal of sickness arises not because of what the organism has done to you but what yourbody is trying to do to the organism In its quest to rid the body of pathogens the immune systemsometimes destroys cells or damages critical tissues so often when you are unwell what you arefeeling is not the pathogens but your own immune responses Anyway getting sick is a sensibleresponse to infection Sick people retire to their beds and thus are less of a threat to the widercommunity Resting also frees more of the body's resources to attend to the infection Because there are so many things out there with the potential to hurt you your_body holds lots ofdifferent varieties of defensive white cells some ten million types in all each designed to identifyand destroy a particular sort of invader It would be impossibly inefficient to maintain ten millionseparate standing armies so each variety of white cell keeps only a few scouts on active duty Whenan infectious agent what's known as an antigen invades relevant scouts identify the attacker andput out a call for reinforcements of the right type While your_body is manufacturing these forces youare likely to feel wretched The onset of recovery begins when the troops finally swing into action White cells are merciless and will hunt down and kill every last pathogen they can find To avoidextinction attackers have evolved two elemental strategies Either they strike quickly and move on toa new host as with common infectious illnesses like flu or they disguise themselves so that the whitecells fail to spot them as with HIV the virus responsible for AIDS which can sit harmlessly andunnoticed in the nuclei of cells for years before springing into action One of the odder aspects of infection is that microbes that normally do no harm at all sometimes getinto the wrong parts of the body and go kind of crazy in the words of Dr Bryan Marsh aninfectious diseases specialist at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon New Hamphire It happens all the time with car accidents when people suffer internal injuries Microbes that arenormally benign in the gut get into other parts of the body the bloodstream for_instance and causeterrible havoc The scariest most out of control bacterial disorder of the moment is a disease called necrotizingfasciitis in which bacteria essentially eat the victim from the inside out devouring internal tissue andleaving behind a pulpy noxious residue Patients often come in with comparatively mild complaints a skin rash and fever typically but then dramatically deteriorate When they are opened up it isoften found that they are simply being consumed The only treatment is what is known as radicalexcisional surgery cutting out every bit of infected area Seventy percent of victims die many ofthe rest are left terribly disfigured The source of the infection is a mundane family of bacteria calledGroup A Streptococcus which normally do no more than cause strep throat Very occasionally forreasons unknown some of these bacteria get through the lining of the throat and into the body proper where they wreak the most devastating havoc They are completely resistant to antibiotics About athousand cases a year occur in the United_States and no one can say that it won't get worse Precisely the same thing happens with meningitis At least percent of young adults and perhaps percent of teenagers carry the deadly meningococcal bacterium but it lives quite harmlessly in thethroat Just occasionally in about one young person in a hundred thousand it gets into thebloodstream and makes them very ill indeed In the worst cases death can come in twelve hours That's shockingly quick You can have a person who's in perfect health at breakfast and dead byevening says Marsh We would have much more success with bacteria if we weren't so profligate with our best weaponagainst them antibiotics Remarkably by one estimate some percent of the antibiotics used in thedeveloped world are given to farm animals often routinely in stock feed simply to promote growthor as a precaution against infection Such applications give bacteria every opportunity to evolve aresistance to them It is an opportunity that they have enthusiastically seized In penicillin was fully effective against all strains of staphylococcus bacteria to such anextent that by the early_s the U_S surgeon general William Stewart felt confident enough todeclare The time has come to close the book on infectious diseases We have basically wiped outinfection in the United_States Even as he spoke however some percent of those strains were inthe process of developing immunity to penicillin Soon one of these new strains called MethicillinResistant Staphylococcus Aureus began to show up in hospitals Only one type of antibiotic vancomycin remained effective against it but in a hospital in Tokyo reported the appearance ofa strain that could resist even that Within months it had spread to six other Japanese hospitals Allover the microbes are beginning to win the war again in U_S hospitals alone some fourteenthousand people a year die from infections they pick up there As James Surowiecki has noted givena choice between developing antibiotics that people will take every day for two weeks orantidepressants that people will take every day forever drug companies not surprisingly opt for thelatter Although a few antibiotics have been toughened up a bit the pharmaceutical industry hasn'tgiven us an entirely new antibiotic since the s Our carelessness is all the more alarming since the discovery that many other ailments may bebacterial in origin The process of discovery began in when Barry Marshall a doctor in Perth Western Australia found that many stomach cancers and most stomach ulcers are caused by abacterium called Helicobacter pylori Even though his findings were easily tested the notion was soradical that more than a decade would pass before they were generally accepted America's NationalInstitutes of Health for_instance didn't officially endorse the idea until Hundreds eventhousands of people must have died from ulcers who wouldn't have Marshall told a reporter fromForbes in Since then further research has shown that there is or may well be a bacterial component in allkinds of other disorders heart disease asthma arthritis multiple sclerosis several types of mentaldisorders many cancers even it has been suggested in Science no less obesity The day may notbe far off when we desperately require an effective antibiotic and haven't got one to call on It may come as a slight comfort to know that bacteria can themselves get sick They are sometimesinfected by bacteriophages or simply phages a type of virus A virus is a strange and unlovelyentity a piece of nucleic acid surrounded by bad_news in the memorable phrase of the Nobellaureate Peter Medawar Smaller and simpler than bacteria viruses aren't themselves alive Inisolation they are inert and harmless But introduce them into a suitable host and they burst intobusyness into life About five thousand types of virus are known and between them they afflict uswith many hundreds of diseases ranging from the flu and common cold to those that are mostinvidious to human well being smallpox rabies yellow fever ebola polio and the humanimmunodeficiency virus the source of AIDS Viruses prosper by hijacking the genetic_material of a living cell and using it to produce morevirus They reproduce in a fanatical manner then burst out in search of more cells to invade Notbeing living organisms themselves they can afford to be very simple Many including HIV have tengenes or fewer whereas even the simplest bacteria require several thousand They are also very tiny much too small to be seen with a conventional microscope It wasn't until and the invention ofthe electron microscope that science got its first look at them But they can do immense damage Smallpox in the twentieth_century alone killed an estimated million people They also have an unnerving capacity to burst upon the world in some new and startling form andthen to vanish again as quickly as they came In in one such case people in Europe andAmerica began to come down with a strange sleeping sickness which became known as encephalitislethargica Victims would go to sleep and not wake up They could be roused without great difficultyto take food or go to the lavatory and would answer questions sensibly they knew who and wherethey were though their manner was always apathetic However the moment they were permitted to rest they would sink at once back into deepestslumber and remain in that state for as long as they were left Some went on in this manner for monthsbefore dying A very few survived and regained consciousness but not their former liveliness Theyexisted in a state of profound apathy like extinct volcanoes in the words of one doctor In ten yearsthe disease killed some five million people and then quietly went away It didn't get much lastingattention because in the meantime an even worse epidemic indeed the worst in history sweptacross the world It is sometimes called the Great Swine Flu epidemic and sometimes the Great Spanish Fluepidemic but in either case it was ferocious World_War I killed twenty one million people in fouryears swine flu did the same in its first four months Almost percent of American casualties in theFirst World_War came not from enemy fire but from flu In some units the mortality rate was as highas percent Swine flu arose as a normal nonlethal flu in the spring of but somehow over the followingmonths no one knows how or where it mutated into something more severe A fifth of victimssuffered only mild symptoms but the rest became gravely ill and often died Some succumbed withinhours others held on for a few days In the United_States the first deaths were recorded among sailors in Boston in late August but the epidemic quickly spread to all parts of the country Schools closed public entertainmentswere shut down people everywhere wore masks It did little good Between the autumn of andspring of the following year people died of the flu in America The toll in Britain was with similar numbers dead in France and Germany No one knows the global toll as recordsin the Third World were often poor but it was not less than million and probably more like million Some estimates have put the global total as high as million In an attempt to devise a vaccine medical authorities conducted tests on volunteers at a militaryprison on Deer Island in Boston Harbor The prisoners were promised pardons if they survived abattery of tests These tests were rigorous to say the least First the subjects were injected withinfected lung tissue taken from the dead and then sprayed in the eyes nose and mouth with infectiousaerosols If they still failed to succumb they had their throats swabbed with discharges taken from thesick and dying If all else failed they were required to sit open mouthed while a gravely ill victimwas helped to cough into their faces Out of somewhat amazingly three hundred men who volunteered the doctors chose sixty twofor the tests None contracted the flu not one The only person who did grow ill was the warddoctor who swiftly died The probable explanation for this is that the epidemic had passed throughthe prison a few weeks earlier and the volunteers all of whom had survived that visitation had anatural immunity Much about the flu is understood poorly or not at all One mystery is how it erupted suddenly all over in places separated by oceans mountain ranges and other earthly impediments A virus cansurvive for no more than a few hours outside a host body so how could it appear in Madrid Bombay and Philadelphia all in the same week The probable answer is that it was incubated and spread by people who had only slight symptomsor none at all Even in normal outbreaks about percent of people have the flu but are unaware of itbecause they experience no ill effects And because they remain in circulation they tend to be the greatspreaders of the disease That would account for the outbreak's widespread distribution but it still doesn't explain howit managed to lay low for several months before erupting so explosively at more or less the same timeall over Even more mysterious is that it was primarily devastating to people in the prime of life Flunormally is hardest on infants and the elderly but in the outbreak deaths were overwhelminglyamong people in their twenties and thirties Older people may have benefited from resistance gainedfrom an earlier exposure to the same strain but why the very young were similarly spared isunknown The greatest mystery of all is why the flu was so ferociously deadly when most flusare not We still have no idea From time to time certain strains of virus return A disagreeable Russian virus known as H N caused severe outbreaks over wide areas in then again in the s and yet again in the s Where it went in the meantime each time is uncertain One suggestion is that viruses hide outunnoticed in populations of wild animals before trying their hand at a new generation of humans Noone can rule out the possibility that the Great Swine Flu epidemic might once again rear its head And if it doesn't others well might New and frightening viruses crop up all the time Ebola Lassa and Marburg fevers all have tended to flare up and die down again but no one can say that they aren'tquietly mutating away somewhere or simply awaiting the right opportunity to burst forth in acatastrophic manner It is now apparent that AIDS has been among us much longer than anyoneoriginally suspected Researchers at the Manchester Royal Infirmary in England discovered that asailor who had died of mysterious untreatable causes in in fact had AIDS But for whateverreasons the disease remained generally quiescent for another twenty years The miracle is that other such diseases haven't gone rampant Lassa fever which wasn't firstdetected until in West Africa is extremely virulent and little understood In a doctor at aYale University lab in New Haven Connecticut who was studying Lassa fever came down with it He survived but more alarmingly a technician in a nearby lab with no direct exposure alsocontracted the disease and died Happily the outbreak stopped there but we can't count on such good fortune always Our lifestylesinvite epidemics Air travel makes it possible to spread infectious agents across the planet withamazing ease An ebola virus could begin the day in say Benin and finish it in New_York orHamburg or Nairobi or all three It means also that medical authorities increasingly need to beacquainted with pretty much every malady that exists everywhere but of course they are not In a Nigerian living in Chicago was exposed to Lassa fever on a visit to his homeland but didn'tdevelop symptoms until he had returned to the United_States He died in a Chicago hospital withoutdiagnosis and without anyone taking any special precautions in treating him unaware that he had oneof the most lethal and infectious diseases on the planet Miraculously no one else was infected Wemay not be so lucky next time And on that sobering note it's time to return to the world of the visibly living LIFE GOES ONIT ISN'T EASY to become a fossil The fate of nearly all living organisms over percent ofthem is to compost down to nothingness When your spark is gone every molecule you own will benibbled off you or sluiced away to be put to use in some other system That's just the way it is Even ifyou make it into the small pool of organisms the less than percent that don't get devoured thechances of being fossilized are very small In order to become a fossil several things must happen First you must die in the right place Onlyabout percent of rocks can preserve fossils so it's no good keeling over on a future site of granite In practical terms the deceased must become buried in sediment where it can leave an impression like a leaf in wet mud or decompose without exposure to oxygen permitting the molecules in itsbones and hard parts and very occasionally softer parts to be replaced by dissolved minerals creating a petrified copy of the original Then as the sediments in which the fossil lies are carelesslypressed and folded and pushed about by Earth's processes the fossil must somehow maintain anidentifiable shape Finally but above all after tens of millions or perhaps hundreds of millions ofyears hidden away it must be found and recognized as something worth keeping Only about one bone in a billion it is thought ever becomes fossilized If that is so it means thatthe complete fossil legacy of all the Americans alive_today that's million people with bones each will only be about fifty bones one quarter of a complete skeleton That's not to say ofcourse that any of these bones will actually be found Bearing in mind that they can be buriedanywhere within an area of slightly over million square miles little of which will ever be turnedover much less examined it would be something of a miracle if they were Fossils are in every sensevanishingly rare Most of what has lived on Earth has left_behind no record at all It has beenestimated that less than one species in ten_thousand has made it into the fossil_record That in itself isa stunningly infinitesimal proportion However if you accept the common estimate that the Earth hasproduced billion species of creature in its time and Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin's statement in The Sixth_Extinction that there are species of creature in the fossil_record that reducesthe proportion to just one in Either way what we possess is the merest sampling of all thelife that Earth has spawned Moreover the record we do have is hopelessly skewed Most land animals of course don't die insediments They drop in the open and are eaten or left to rot or weather down to nothing The fossilrecord consequently is almost absurdly biased in favor of marine creatures About percent of allthe fossils we possess are of animals that once lived under water mostly in shallow seas I mention all this to explain why on a gray day in February I went to the Natural_History_Museum inLondon to meet a cheerful vaguely rumpled very likeable paleontologist named Richard_Fortey Fortey knows an awful lot about an awful lot He is the author of a wry splendid book called Life An Unauthorised Biography which covers the whole pageant of animate creation But his first loveis a type of marine creature called trilobites that once teemed in Ordovician seas but haven't existedfor a long time except in fossilized form All shared a basic body plan of three parts or lobes head tail thorax from which comes the name Fortey found his first when he was a boy clambering overrocks at St David's Bay in Wales He was hooked for life He took me to a gallery of tall metal cupboards Each cupboard was filled with shallow drawers and each drawer was filled with stony trilobites twenty thousand specimens in all It seems like a big number he agreed but you have to remember that millions_upon millions oftrilobites lived for millions_upon millions of years in ancient seas so twenty thousand isn't a hugenumber And most of these are only partial specimens Finding a complete trilobite fossil is still a bigmoment for a paleontologist Trilobites first appeared fully formed seemingly from nowhere about million_years_ago near the start of the great outburst of complex life popularly known as the Cambrian_explosion andthen vanished along with a great_deal else in the great and still mysterious Permian extinction or so centuries later As with all extinct creatures there is a natural temptation to regardthem as failures but in fact they were among the most successful animals ever to live Their reign ranfor million_years twice the span of dinosaurs which were themselves one of history's greatsurvivors Humans Fortey points out have survived so far for one half of percent as long With so much time at their disposal the trilobites proliferated prodigiously Most remained small about the size of modern beetles but some grew to be as big as platters Altogether they formed atleast five thousand genera and sixty thousand species though more turn up all the time Fortey hadrecently been at a conference in South_America where he was approached by an academic from asmall provincial university in Argentina She had a box that was full of interesting things trilobitesthat had never been seen before in South_America or indeed anywhere and a great_deal else She hadno research facilities to study them and no funds to look for more Huge parts of the world are stillunexplored In terms of trilobites No in terms of everything Throughout the nineteenth_century trilobites were almost the only known forms of early complex life and for that reason were assiduously collected and studied The big mystery about them was theirsudden appearance Even now as Fortey says it can be startling to go to the right formation of rocksand to work your way upward through the eons finding no visible life at all and then suddenly awhole Profallotaspis or Elenellus as big as a crab will pop into your waiting hands These werecreatures with limbs gills nervous systems probing antennae a brain of sorts in Fortey's words and the strangest eyes ever seen Made of calcite rods the same stuff that forms limestone theyconstituted the earliest visual systems known More than this the earliest trilobites didn't consist ofjust one venturesome species but dozens and didn't appear in one or two locations but all over Manythinking people in the nineteenth_century saw this as proof of God's handiwork and refutation ofDarwin's evolutionary ideals If evolution proceeded slowly they asked then how did he account forthis sudden appearance of complex fully formed creatures The fact is he couldn't And so matters seemed destined to remain forever until one day in three months shy of thefiftieth anniversary of the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species when a paleontologistnamed Charles Doolittle Walcott made an extraordinary find in the Canadian Rockies Walcott was born in and grew up near Utica New_York in a family of modest means whichbecame more modest still with the sudden death of his father when Walcott was an infant As a boyWalcott discovered that he had a knack for finding fossils particularly trilobites and built up acollection of sufficient distinction that it was bought by Louis Agassiz for his museum at Harvard fora small fortune about in today's_money Although he had barely a high school education andwas self taught in the sciences Walcott became a leading authority on trilobites and was the firstperson to establish that trilobites were arthropods the group that includes modern insects andcrustaceans In he took a job as a field researcher with the newly formed United_States Geological Surveyand served with such distinction that within fifteen years he had risen to be its head In he wasappointed secretary of the Smithsonian Institution where he remained until his death in Despitehis administrative obligations he continued to do fieldwork and to write prolifically His books filla library shelf according to Fortey Not incidentally he was also a founding director of the NationalAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics which eventually became the National Aeronautics and SpaceAgency or NASA and thus can rightly be considered the grandfather of the space age But what he is remembered for now is an astute but lucky find in British Columbia high above thelittle town of Field in the late summer of The customary version of the story is that Walcott accompanied by his wife was riding on horseback on a mountain trail beneath the spot called theBurgess Ridge when his wife's horse slipped on loose stones Dismounting to assist her Walcottdiscovered that the horse had turned a slab of shale that contained fossil crustaceans of an especiallyancient and unusual type Snow was falling winter comes early to the Canadian Rockies so theydidn't linger but the next year at the first opportunity Walcott returned to the spot Tracing thepresumed route of the rocks' slide he climbed feet to near the mountain's summit There feet above sea level he found a shale outcrop about the length of a city block containing anunrivaled array of fossils from soon_after the moment when complex life burst forth in dazzlingprofusion the famous Cambrian_explosion Walcott had found in effect the holy grail ofpaleontology The outcrop became known as the Burgess_Shale and for a long time it provided oursole vista upon the inception of modern life in all its fullness as the late Stephen_Jay Gouldrecorded in his popular_book Wonderful_Life Gould ever scrupulous discovered from reading Walcott's diaries that the story of the BurgessShale's discovery appears to have been somewhat embroidered Walcott makes no mention of aslipping horse or falling snow but there is no disputing that it was an extraordinary find It is almost impossible for us whose time on Earth is limited to a breezy few decades to appreciatehow remote in time from us the Cambrian outburst was If you could fly backwards into the past at therate of one year per second it would take you about half an_hour to reach the time of Christ and alittle over three weeks to get back to the beginnings of human life But it would take you twenty yearsto reach the dawn of the Cambrian_period It was in other words an extremely long time ago and theworld was a very different place For one thing million plus years_ago when the Burgess_Shale was formed it wasn't at the topof a mountain but at the foot of one Specifically it was a shallow ocean basin at the bottom of a steepcliff The seas of that time teemed with life but normally the animals left no record because they weresoft bodied and decayed upon dying But at Burgess the cliff collapsed and the creatures below entombed in a mudslide were pressed like flowers in a book their features preserved in wondrousdetail In annual summer trips from to by which time he was seventy five years_old Walcottexcavated tens of thousands of specimens Gould says the normally unimpeachable factcheckers of National Georgraphic say which he brought back to Washington for furtherstudy In both sheer numbers and diversity the collection was unparalleled Some of the Burgessfossils had shells many others did not Some were sighted others blind The variety was enormous consisting of species by one count The Burgess_Shale included a range of disparity inanatomical designs never again equaled and not matched today by all the creatures in the world'soceans Gould wrote Unfortunately according to Gould Walcott failed to discern the significance of what he had found Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory Gould wrote in another work Eight_Little Piggies Walcott then proceeded to misinterpret these magnificent fossils in the deepest possible way Heplaced them into modern groups making them ancestral to today's worms jellyfish and othercreatures and thus failed to appreciate their distinctness Under such an interpretation Gouldsighed life began in primordial simplicity and moved inexorably predictably onward to more andbetter Walcott died in and the Burgess fossils were largely forgotten For nearly half a century theystayed shut away in drawers in the American_Museum of Natural_History in Washington seldomconsulted and never questioned Then in a graduate_student from Cambridge University namedSimon Conway Morris paid a visit to the collection He was astonished by what he found The fossilswere far more varied and magnificent than Walcott had indicated in his writings In taxonomy thecategory that describes the basic body plans of all organisms is the phylum and here Conway Morrisconcluded were drawer after drawer of such anatomical singularities all amazingly andunaccountably unrecognized by the man who had found them With his supervisor Harry Whittington and fellow graduate_student Derek Briggs Conway Morrisspent the next several years making a systematic revision of the entire collection and cranking out oneexciting monograph after another as discovery piled upon discovery Many of the creatures employedbody plans that were not simply unlike anything seen before or since but were bizarrely different One Opabinia had five eyes and a nozzle like snout with claws on the end Another a disc shapedbeing called Peytoia looked almost comically like a pineapple slice A third had evidently totteredabout on rows of stilt like legs and was so odd that they named it Hallucigenia There was so muchunrecognized novelty in the collection that at one point upon opening a new drawer Conway Morrisfamously was heard to mutter Oh fuck not another phylum The English team's revisions showed that the Cambrian had been a time of unparalleled innovationand experimentation in body designs For almost four billion years life had dawdled along withoutany detectable ambitions in the direction of complexity and then suddenly in the space of just five orten million_years it had created all the basic body designs still in use today Name a creature from anematode worm to Cameron Diaz and they all use architecture first created in the Cambrian party What was most surprising however was that there were so many body designs that had failed tomake the cut so to speak and left no descendants Altogether according to Gould at_least fifteen andperhaps as many as twenty of the Burgess animals belonged to no recognized phylum The numbersoon grew in some popular accounts to as many as one hundred far more than the Cambridgescientists ever actually claimed The history of life wrote Gould is a story of massive removalfollowed by differentiation within a few surviving stocks not the conventional tale of steadilyincreasing excellence complexity and diversity Evolutionary success it appeared was a lottery One creature that did manage to slip through a small wormlike being called Pikaia gracilens wasfound to have a primitive spinal column making it the earliest known ancestor of all later vertebrates including us Pikaia were by no means abundant among the Burgess fossils so goodness knows howclose they may have come to extinction Gould in a famous quotation leaves no doubt that he seesour lineal success as a fortunate fluke Wind back the tape of life to the early days of the BurgessShale let it play again from an identical starting point and the chance becomes vanishingly small thatanything like human intelligence would grace the replay Gould's book was published in to general critical acclaim and was a great commercialsuccess What wasn't generally known was that many scientists didn't agree with Gould's conclusionsat all and that it was all soon to get very ugly In the context of the Cambrian_explosion wouldsoon have more to do with modern tempers than ancient physiological facts In_fact we now know complex organisms existed at_least a hundred million_years before theCambrian We should have known a whole lot sooner Nearly forty years after Walcott made hisdiscovery in Canada on the other side of the planet in Australia a young geologist_named ReginaldSprigg found something even older and in its way just as remarkable In Sprigg was a young assistant government geologist for the state of South Australia when hewas sent to make a survey of abandoned mines in the Ediacaran Hills of the Flinders Range anexpanse of baking outback some three hundred miles north of Adelaide The idea was to see if therewere any old mines that might be profitably reworked using newer technologies so he wasn't studyingsurface rocks at all still less fossils But one day while eating his lunch Sprigg idly overturned ahunk of sandstone and was surprised to put it mildly to see that the rock's surface was covered indelicate fossils rather like the impressions leaves make in mud These rocks predated the Cambrianexplosion He was looking at the dawn of visible life Sprigg submitted a paper to Nature but it was turned down He read it instead at the next annualmeeting of the Australian and New_Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science but it failedto find favor with the association's head who said the Ediacaran imprints were merely fortuitousinorganic markings patterns made by wind or rain or tides but not living beings His hopes not yetentirely crushed Sprigg traveled to London and presented his findings to the InternationalGeological Congress but failed to excite either interest or belief Finally for want of a better outlet he published his findings in the Transactions of the Royal_Society of South Australia Then he quithis government job and took up oil exploration Nine years later in a schoolboy named John Mason while walking through CharnwoodForest in the English Midlands found a rock with a strange fossil in it similar to a modern sea penand exactly like some of the specimens Sprigg had found and been trying to tell everyone about eversince The schoolboy turned it in to a paleontologist at the University of Leicester who identified it atonce as Precambrian Young Mason got his picture in the papers and was treated as a precocioushero he still is in many books The specimen was named in his honor Chamia masoni Today some of Sprigg's original Ediacaran specimens along with many of the other fifteen hundredspecimens that have been found throughout the Flinders Range since that time can be seen in a glasscase in an upstairs room of the stout and lovely South Australian Museum in Adelaide but they don'tattract a great_deal of attention The delicately etched patterns are rather faint and not terriblyarresting to the untrained eye They are mostly small and disc shaped with occasional vague trailingribbons Fortey has described them as soft bodied oddities There is still very little agreement about what these things were or how they lived They had as faras can be told no mouth or anus with which to take in and discharge digestive materials and nointernal organs with which to process them along the way In life Fortey says most of themprobably simply lay upon the surface of the sandy sediment like soft structureless and inanimateflatfish At their liveliest they were no more complex than jellyfish All the Ediacaran creatureswere diploblastic meaning they were built from two layers of tissue With the exception of jellyfish all animals today are triploblastic Some experts think they weren't animals at all but more like plants or fungi The distinctionsbetween plant and animal are not always clear even now The modern sponge spends its life fixed toa single spot and has no eyes or brain or beating heart and yet is an animal When we go back to thePrecambrian the differences between plants and animals were probably even less clear says Fortey There isn't any rule that says you have to be demonstrably one or the other Nor is it agreed that the Ediacaran organisms are in any way ancestral to anything alive_today except possibly some jellyfish Many authorities see them as a kind of failed experiment a stab atcomplexity that didn't take possibly because the sluggish Ediacaran organisms were devoured oroutcompeted by the lither and more sophisticated animals of the Cambrian_period There is nothing closely similar alive_today Fortey has written They are difficult to interpretas any kind of ancestors of what was to follow The feeling was that ultimately they weren't terribly important to the development of life on Earth Many authorities believe that there was a mass extermination at the Precambrian Cambrian boundaryand that all the Ediacaran creatures except the uncertain jellyfish failed to move on to the nextphase The real business of complex life in other words started with the Cambrian_explosion That'show Gould saw it in any case As for the revisions of the Burgess_Shale fossils almost at once people began to question theinterpretations and in particular Gould's interpretation of the interpretations From the first therewere a number of scientists who doubted the account that Steve Gould had presented however muchthey admired the manner of its delivery Fortey wrote in Life That is putting it mildly If only Stephen Gould could think as clearly as he writes barked the Oxford academic RichardDawkins in the opening line of a review in the London Sunday Telegraph of Wonderful_Life Dawkins acknowledged that the book was unputdownable and a literary tour de force butaccused Gould of engaging in a grandiloquent and near disingenuous misrepresentation of the factsby suggesting that the Burgess revisions had stunned the paleontological community The view thathe is attacking that evolution marches inexorably toward a pinnacle such as man has not beenbelieved for years Dawkins fumed And yet that was exactly the conclusion to which many general reviewers were drawn One writing in the New_York_Times Book Review cheerfully suggested that as a result of Gould's bookscientists have been throwing out some preconceptions that they had not examined for generations They are reluctantly or enthusiastically accepting the idea that humans are as much an accident ofnature as a product of orderly development But the real heat directed at Gould arose from the belief that many of his conclusions were simplymistaken or carelessly inflated Writing in the journal Evolution Dawkins attacked Gould'sassertions that evolution in the Cambrian was a different kind of process from today and expressedexasperation at Gould's repeated suggestions that the Cambrian was a period of evolutionary experiment ' evolutionary trial and error ' evolutionary false starts ' It was the fertile time whenall the great fundamental body plans' were invented Nowadays evolution just tinkers with old bodyplans Back in the Cambrian new phyla and new classes arose Nowadays we only get new species Noting how often this idea that there are no new body plans is picked up Dawkins says It isas though a gardener looked at an oak tree and remarked wonderingly Isn't it strange that no majornew boughs have appeared on this tree for many years These days all the new growth appears to beat the twig level ' It was a strange time Fortey says now especially when you reflected that this was all aboutsomething that happened five hundred million_years_ago but feelings really did run quite high I jokedin one of my books that I felt as if I ought to put a safety helmet on before writing about the Cambrianperiod but it did actually feel a bit like that Strangest of all was the response of one of the heroes of Wonderful_Life Simon Conway Morris who startled many in the paleontological community by rounding abruptly on Gould in a book of hisown The Crucible of Creation The book treated Gould with contempt even loathing in Fortey'swords I have never encountered such spleen in a book by a professional Fortey wrote later Thecasual reader of The Crucible of Creation unaware of the history would never gather that theauthor's views had once been close to if not actually shared with Gould's When I_asked Fortey about it he said Well it was very strange quite shocking really becauseGould's portrayal of him had been so flattering I could only assume that Simon was embarrassed You know science changes but books are permanent and I suppose he regretted being soirremediably associated_with views that he no_longer altogether held There was all that stuff about oh fuck another phylum' and I expect he regretted being famous for that What happened was that the early Cambrian fossils began to undergo a period of criticalreappraisal Fortey and Derek Briggs one of the other principals in Gould's book used a methodknown as cladistics to compare the various Burgess fossils In simple terms cladistics consists oforganizing organisms on the basis of shared features Fortey gives as an example the idea ofcomparing a shrew and an elephant If you considered the elephant's large size and striking trunk youmight conclude that it could have little in common with a tiny sniffing shrew But if you comparedboth of them with a lizard you would see that the elephant and shrew were in fact built to much thesame plan In essence what Fortey is saying is that Gould saw elephants and shrews where they sawmammals The Burgess creatures they believed weren't as strange and various as they appeared atfirst sight They were often no stranger than trilobites Fortey says now It is just that we have hada century or so to get used to trilobites Familiarity you know breeds familiarity This wasn't I should note because of sloppiness or inattention Interpreting the forms andrelationships of ancient animals on the basis of often distorted and fragmentary evidence is clearly atricky business Edward_O_Wilson has noted that if you took selected species of modern insects andpresented them as Burgess style fossils nobody would ever guess that they were all from the samephylum so different are their body plans Also instrumental in helping revisions were the discoveriesof two further early Cambrian sites one in Greenland and one in China plus more scattered finds which between them yielded many additional and often better specimens The upshot is that the Burgess fossils were found to be not so different after all Hallucigenia itturned out had been reconstructed upside down Its stilt like legs were actually spikes along its back Peytoia the weird creature that looked like a pineapple slice was found to be not a distinct creaturebut merely part of a larger animal called Anomalocaris Many of the Burgess specimens have nowbeen assigned to living phyla just where Walcott put them in the first place Hallucigenia and someothers are thought to be related to Onychophora a group of caterpillar like animals Others havebeen reclassified as precursors of the modern annelids In_fact says Fortey there are relatively fewCambrian designs that are wholly novel More often they turn out to be just interesting elaborations ofwell established designs As he wrote in his book Life None was as strange as a present daybarnacle nor as grotesque as a queen termite So the Burgess_Shale specimens weren't so spectacular after all This made them as Fortey haswritten no less interesting or odd just more explicable Their weird body plans were just a kindof youthful exuberance the evolutionary equivalent as it were of spiked hair and tongue studs Eventually the forms settled into a staid and stable middle age But that still left the enduring question of where all these animals had come from how they hadsuddenly appeared from out of nowhere Alas it turns_out the Cambrian_explosion may not have been quite so explosive as all that TheCambrian animals it is now thought were probably there all along but were just too small to see Once again it was trilobites that provided the clue in particular that seemingly mystifyingappearance of different types of trilobite in widely scattered locations around the globe all at moreor less the same time On the face of it the sudden appearance of lots of fully formed but varied creatures would seem toenhance the miraculousness of the Cambrian outburst but in fact it did the opposite It is one thing tohave one well formed creature like a trilobite burst forth in isolation that really is a wonder but tohave many of them all distinct but clearly related turning up simultaneously in the fossil_record inplaces as far apart as China and New_York clearly suggests that we are missing a big part of theirhistory There could be no stronger evidence that they simply had to have a forebear somegrandfather species that started the line in a much earlier past And the reason we haven't found these earlier species it is now thought is that they were too tinyto be preserved Says Fortey It isn't necessary to be big to be a perfectly functioning complexorganism The sea swarms with tiny arthropods today that have left no fossil_record He cites thelittle copepod which numbers in the trillions in modern seas and clusters in shoals large enough toturn vast areas of the ocean black and yet our total knowledge of its ancestry is a single specimenfound in the body of an ancient fossilized fish The Cambrian_explosion if that's the word for it probably was more an increase in size than asudden appearance of new body types Fortey says And it could have happened quite swiftly so inthat sense I suppose it was an explosion The idea is that just as mammals bided their time for ahundred million_years until the dinosaurs cleared off and then seemingly burst forth in profusion allover the planet so too perhaps the arthropods and other triploblasts waited in semimicroscopicanonymity for the dominant Ediacaran organisms to have their day Says Fortey We know thatmammals increased in size quite dramatically after the dinosaurs went though when I say quiteabruptly I of course mean it in a geological sense We're still talking millions of years Incidentally Reginald Sprigg did eventually get a measure of overdue credit One of the main earlygenera Spriggina was named in his honor as were several species and the whole became known asthe Ediacaran fauna after the hills through which he had searched By this time however Sprigg'sfossil hunting days were long over After leaving geology he founded a successful oil company andeventually retired to an estate in his beloved Flinders Range where he created a wildlife reserve Hedied in a rich man GOOD BYE TO ALL THATWHEN YOU CONSIDER it from a human perspective and clearly it would be difficult for us to dootherwise life is an odd thing It couldn't wait to get going but then having gotten going it seemed invery little hurry to move on Consider the lichen Lichens are just about the hardiest visible organisms on Earth but among theleast ambitious They will grow happily enough in a sunny churchyard but they particularly thrive inenvironments where no other organism would go on blowy mountaintops and arctic wastes wherever there is little but rock and rain and cold and almost no competition In areas of Antarcticawhere virtually nothing else will grow you can find vast expanses of lichen four_hundred types ofthem adhering devotedly to every wind whipped rock For a long time people couldn't understand how they did it Because lichens grew on bare rockwithout evident nourishment or the production of seeds many people educated people believedthey were stones caught in the process of becoming plants Spontaneously inorganic stone becomesliving plant rejoiced one observer a Dr Homschuch in Closer inspection showed that lichens were more interesting than magical They are in fact apartnership between fungi and algae The fungi excrete acids that dissolve the surface of the rock freeing minerals that the algae convert into food sufficient to sustain both It is not a very excitingarrangement but it is a conspicuously successful one The world has more than twenty thousandspecies of lichens Like most things that thrive in harsh environments lichens are slow growing It may take a lichenmore than half a century to attain the dimensions of a shirt button Those the size of dinner plates writes David Attenborough are therefore likely to be hundreds if not thousands of years_old Itwould be hard to imagine a less fulfilling existence They simply exist Attenborough adds testifying to the moving fact that life even at its simplest level occurs apparently just for its ownsake It is easy to overlook this thought that life just is As humans we are inclined to feel that life musthave a point We have plans and aspirations and desires We want to take constant advantage of allthe intoxicating existence we've been endowed with But what's life to a lichen Yet its impulse toexist to be is every bit as strong as ours arguably even stronger If I were told that I had to spenddecades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods I believe I would lose the will to go on Lichensdon't Like virtually all living_things they will suffer any hardship endure any insult for a moment'sadditional existence Life in short just wants to be But and here's an interesting point for themost part it doesn't want to be much This is perhaps a little odd because life has had plenty of time to develop ambitions If you imaginethe billion odd years of Earth's history compressed into a normal earthly day then life beginsvery early about A M with the rise of the first simple single celled organisms but then advancesno further for the next sixteen hours Not_until almost in the evening with the day five sixthsover has Earth anything to show the universe but a restless skin of microbes Then finally the firstsea plants appear followed twenty minutes later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaranfauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in Australia At P M trilobites swim onto the scene followedmore or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Burgess_Shale Just before P M plantsbegin to pop up on the land Soon after with less than two hours left in the day the first land creaturesfollow Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather by the Earth is covered in the greatcarboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal and the first winged insects are evident Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before P M and hold sway for about three quarters of an_hour At twenty one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins Humans emerge oneminute and seventeen seconds before midnight The whole of our recorded history on this scale would be no more than a few seconds a single human lifetime barely an instant Throughout thisgreatly speeded up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positivelyreckless Mountains rise and melt away ocean basins come and go ice_sheets advance and withdraw And throughout the whole about three times every minute somewhere on the planet there is aflashbulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson sized meteor or one even larger It's a wonderthat anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment In_fact not many thingsdo for long Perhaps an even more effective way of grasping our extreme recentness as a part of this billion year old picture is to stretch your arms to their fullest extent and imagine that width as theentire history of the Earth On this scale according to John McPhee in Basin and Range the distancefrom the fingertips of one hand to the wrist of the other is Precambrian All of complex life is in onehand and in a single stroke with a medium grained nail file you could eradicate human history Fortunately that moment hasn't happened but the chances are good that it will I don't wish tointerject a note of gloom just at this point but the fact is that there is one other extremely pertinentquality about life on Earth it goes extinct Quite regularly For all the trouble they take to assembleand preserve themselves species crumple and die remarkably routinely And the more complex theyget the more quickly they appear to go extinct Which is perhaps one reason why so much of life isn'tterribly ambitious So anytime life does something bold it is quite an event and few occasions were more eventful thanwhen life moved on to the next stage in our narrative and came out of the sea Land was a formidable environment hot dry bathed in intense ultraviolet radiation lacking thebuoyancy that makes movement in water comparatively effortless To live on land creatures had toundergo wholesale revisions of their anatomies Hold a fish at each end and it sags in the middle itsbackbone too weak to support it To survive out of water marine creatures needed to come up withnew load bearing internal architecture not the sort of adjustment that happens overnight Above alland most obviously any land creature would have to develop a way to take its oxygen directly fromthe air rather than filter it from water These were not trivial challenges to overcome On the otherhand there was a powerful incentive to leave the water it was getting dangerous down there Theslow fusion of the continents into a single landmass Pangaea meant there was much much lesscoastline than formerly and thus much less coastal habitat So competition was fierce There was alsoan omnivorous and unsettling new type of predator on the scene one so perfectly designed for attackthat it has scarcely changed in all the long eons since its emergence the shark Never would there bea more propitious time to find an alternative environment to water Plants began the process of land colonization about million_years_ago accompanied ofnecessity by tiny mites and other organisms that they needed to break down and recycle dead organicmatter on their behalf Larger animals took a little longer to emerge but by about million yearsago they were venturing out of the water too Popular illustrations have encouraged us to envision thefirst venturesome land dwellers as a kind of ambitious fish something like the modern mudskipper which can hop from puddle to puddle during droughts or even as a fully formed amphibian In_fact the first visible mobile residents on dry land were probably much more like modern wood lice sometimes also known as pillbugs or sow bugs These are the little bugs crustaceans in fact that arecommonly thrown into confusion when you upturn a rock or log For those that learned to breathe oxygen from the air times were good Oxygen levels in theDevonian and Carboniferous periods when terrestrial life first bloomed were as high as percent as opposed to nearer percent now This allowed animals to grow remarkably large remarkablyquickly And how you may reasonably wonder can scientists know what oxygen levels were like hundredsof millions of years_ago The answer lies in a slightly obscure but ingenious field known as isotopegeochemistry The long ago seas of the Carboniferous and Devonian swarmed with tiny plankton thatwrapped themselves inside tiny protective shells Then as now the plankton created their shells bydrawing oxygen from the atmosphere and combining it with other elements carbon especially toform durable compounds such as calcium carbonate It's the same chemical trick that goes on in andis discussed elsewhere in relation to the long term carbon cycle a process that doesn't make forterribly exciting narrative but is vital for creating a livable planet Eventually in this process all the tiny organisms die and drift to the bottom of the sea where theyare slowly compressed into limestone Among the tiny atomic structures the plankton take to the gravewith them are two very stable isotopes oxygen and oxygen If you have forgotten what anisotope is it doesn't matter though for the record it's an atom with an abnormal number of neutrons This is where the geochemists come in for the isotopes accumulate at different rates depending onhow much oxygen or carbon_dioxide is in the atmosphere at the time of their creation By comparingthese ancient ratios the geochemists can cunningly read conditions in the ancient world oxygenlevels air and ocean temperatures the extent and timing of ice_ages and much else By combiningtheir isotope findings with other fossil residues pollen levels and so on scientists can withconsiderable confidence re create entire landscapes that no human eye ever saw The principal reason oxygen levels were able to build up so robustly throughout the period of earlyterrestrial life was that much of the world's landscape was dominated by giant tree ferns and vastswamps which by their boggy nature disrupted the normal carbon recycling process Instead ofcompletely rotting down falling fronds and other dead vegetative matter accumulated in rich wetsediments which were eventually squeezed into the vast coal beds that sustain much economicactivity even now The heady levels of oxygen clearly encouraged outsized growth The oldest indication of a surfaceanimal yet found is a track left million_years_ago by a millipede like creature on a rock inScotland It was over three feet long Before the era was out some millipedes would reach lengthsmore than double that With such creatures on the prowl it is perhaps not surprising that insects in the period evolved atrick that could keep them safely out of tongue shot they learned to fly Some took to this new meansof locomotion with such uncanny facility that they haven't changed their techniques in all the timesince Then as now dragonflies could cruise at up to thirty five miles an_hour instantly stop hover fly backwards and lift far more proportionately than any human flying machine The U_S AirForce one commentator has written has put them in wind tunnels to see how they do it anddespaired They too gorged on the rich air In Carboniferous forests dragonflies grew as big asravens Trees and other vegetation likewise attained outsized proportions Horsetails and tree fernsgrew to heights of fifty feet club mosses to a hundred and thirty The first terrestrial vertebrates which is to say the first land animals from which we wouldderive are something of a mystery This is partly because of a shortage of relevant fossils but partlyalso because of an idiosyncratic Swede named Erik Jarvik whose odd interpretations and secretivemanner held back progress on this question for almost half a century Jarvik was part of a team ofScandinavian scholars who went to Greenland in the s and s looking for fossil fish Inparticular they sought lobe finned fish of the type that presumably were ancestral to us and all otherwalking creatures known as tetrapods Most animals are tetrapods and all living tetrapods have one thing in common four limbs that endin a maximum of five fingers or toes Dinosaurs whales birds humans even fish all are tetrapods which clearly suggests they come from a single common ancestor The clue to this ancestor it wasassumed would be found in the Devonian era from about million_years_ago Before that timenothing walked on land After that time lots of things did Luckily the team found just such a creature a three foot long animal called an Ichthyostega The analysis of the fossil fell to Jarvik who beganhis study in and kept at it for the next forty eight years Unfortunately Jarvik refused to letanyone study his tetrapod The world's paleontologists had to be content with two sketchy interimpapers in which Jarvik noted that the creature had five fingers in each of four limbs confirming itsancestral importance Jarvik died in After his death other paleontologists eagerly examined the specimen andfound that Jarvik had severely miscounted the fingers and toes there were actually eight on eachlimb and failed to observe that the fish could not possibly have walked The structure of the fin wassuch that it would have collapsed under its own weight Needless to say this did not do a great dealto advance our_understanding of the first land animals Today three early tetrapods are known andnone has five digits In short we_don't_know quite where we came from But come we did though reaching our present state of eminence has not of course always beenstraightforward Since life on land began it has consisted of four megadynasties as they aresometimes called The first consisted of primitive plodding but sometimes fairly hefty amphibiansand reptiles The best known animal of this age was the Dimetrodon a sail backed creature that iscommonly confused with dinosaurs including I note in a picture caption in the Carl Sagan bookComet The Dimetrodon was in fact a synapsid So once upon a time were we Synapsids were oneof the four main divisions of early reptilian life the others being anapsids euryapsids and diapsids The names simply refer to the number and location of small holes to be found in the sides of theirowners' skulls Synapsids had one hole in their lower temples diapsids had two euryapsids had asingle hole higher up Over time each of these principal groupings split into further subdivisions of which someprospered and some faltered Anapsids gave rise to the turtles which for a time perhaps a touchimprobably appeared poised to predominate as the planet's most advanced and deadly species before an evolutionary lurch let them settle for durability rather than dominance The synapsidsdivided into four streams only one of which survived beyond the Permian Happily that was thestream we belonged to and it evolved into a family of protomammals known as therapsids Theseformed Megadynasty Unfortunately for the therapsids their cousins the diapsids were also productively evolving intheir case into dinosaurs among other things which gradually proved too much for the therapsids Unable to compete head to head with these aggressive new creatures the therapsids by and largevanished from the record A very few however evolved into small furry burrowing beings thatbided their time for a very long while as little mammals The biggest of them grew no larger than ahouse cat and most were no bigger_than mice Eventually this would prove their salvation but theywould have to wait nearly million_years for Megadynasty the Age of Dinosaurs to come to anabrupt end and make room for Megadynasty and our_own Age of Mammals Each of these massive transformations as well as many smaller ones between and since wasdependent on that paradoxically important motor of progress extinction It is a curious fact that onEarth species death is in the most literal sense a way of life No one knows how many species oforganisms have existed since life began Thirty billion is a commonly cited figure but the number hasbeen put as high as billion Whatever the actual total percent of all species that haveever lived are no_longer with us To a first approximation as David Raup of the University ofChicago likes to say all species are extinct For complex organisms the average lifespan of aspecies is only about four million_years roughly about where we are now Extinction is always bad_news for the victims of course but it appears to be a good thing for adynamic planet The alternative to extinction is stagnation says Ian_Tattersall of the AmericanMuseum of Natural_History and stagnation is seldom a good thing in any realm I should perhapsnote that we are speaking here of extinction as a natural long term process Extinction brought aboutby human carelessness is another matter altogether Crises in Earth's history are invariably associated_with dramatic leaps afterward The fall of theEdiacaran fauna was followed by the creative outburst of the Cambrian_period The Ordovicianextinction of million_years_ago cleared the oceans of a lot of immobile filter feeders and somehow created conditions that favored darting fish and giant aquatic reptiles These in turn were inan ideal position to send colonists onto dry land when another blowout in the late Devonian periodgave life another sound shaking And so it has gone at scattered intervals through history If most ofthese events hadn't happened just as they did just when they did we almost_certainly wouldn't be herenow Earth has seen five major extinction episodes in its time the Ordovician Devonian Permian Triassic and Cretaceous in that order and many smaller ones The Ordovician million yearsago and Devonian million each wiped_out about to percent of species The Triassic million_years_ago and Cretaceous million_years each wiped_out to percent of species Butthe real whopper was the Permian extinction of about million_years_ago which raised the curtainon the long age of the dinosaurs In the Permian at_least percent of animals known from the fossilrecord check out never to return Even about a third of insect species went the only occasion onwhich they were lost en masse It is as close as we have ever come to total obliteration It was truly a mass extinction a carnage of a magnitude that had never troubled the Earthbefore says Richard_Fortey The Permian event was particularly devastating to sea creatures Trilobites vanished altogether Clams and sea urchins nearly went Virtually all other marineorganisms were staggered Altogether on land and in the water it is thought that Earth lost percentof its families that's the level above genus and below order on the grand scale of life the subject ofthe next chapter and perhaps as many as percent of all its species It would be a long time asmuch as eighty million_years by one reckoning before species totals recovered Two points need to be kept in mind First these are all just informed guesses Estimates for thenumber of animal species alive at the end of the Permian range from as low as to as high as If you don't_know how many species were alive you can hardly specify with conviction theproportion that perished Moreover we are talking_about the death of species not individuals Forindividuals the death toll could be much higher in many cases practically total The species thatsurvived to the next phase of life's lottery almost_certainly owe their existence to a few scarred andlimping survivors In between the big kill offs there have also been many smaller less well known extinctionepisodes the Hemphillian Frasnian Famennian Rancholabrean and a dozen or so others whichwere not so devastating to total species numbers but often critically hit certain populations Grazinganimals including horses were nearly wiped_out in the Hemphillian event about five million yearsago Horses declined to a single species which appears so sporadically in the fossil_record as tosuggest that for a time it teetered on the brink of oblivion Imagine a human history without horses without grazing animals In nearly every case for both big extinctions and more modest ones we have bewilderingly littleidea of what the cause was Even after stripping out the more crackpot notions there are still moretheories for what caused the extinction events than there have been events At least two dozenpotential culprits have been identified as causes or prime contributors global warming globalcooling changing sea levels oxygen depletion of the seas a condition known as anoxia epidemics giant leaks of methane gas from the seafloor meteor and comet impacts runaway hurricanes of a typeknown as hypercanes huge volcanic upwellings catastrophic solar flares This last is a particularly intriguing possibility Nobody knows how big solar flares can getbecause we have only been watching them since the beginning of the space age but the Sun is amighty engine and its storms are commensurately enormous A typical solar flare something wewouldn't even notice on Earth will release the energy equivalent of a billion hydrogen bombs andfling into space a hundred billion_tons or so of murderous high energy particles The magnetosphereand atmosphere between them normally swat these back into space or steer them safely toward thepoles where they produce the Earth's comely auroras but it is thought that an unusually big blast say a hundred times the typical flare could overwhelm our ethereal defenses The light show wouldbe a glorious one but it would almost_certainly kill a very high proportion of all that basked in itsglow Moreover and rather chillingly according to Bruce Tsurutani of the NASA Jet PropulsionLaboratory it would leave no trace in history What all this leaves us with as one researcher has put it is tons of conjecture and very littleevidence Cooling seems to be associated_with at_least three of the big extinction events theOrdovician Devonian and Permian but beyond that little is agreed including whether a particularepisode happened swiftly or slowly Scientists can't agree for_instance whether the late Devonianextinction the event that was followed by vertebrates moving onto the land happened overmillions of years or thousands of years or in one lively day One of the reasons it is so hard to produce convincing explanations for extinctions is that it is sovery hard to exterminate life on a grand scale As we have seen from the Manson impact you canreceive a ferocious blow and still stage a full if presumably somewhat wobbly recovery So why out of all the thousands of impacts Earth has endured was the KT event so singularly devastating Well first it was positively enormous It struck with the force of million megatons Such anoutburst is not easily imagined but as James Lawrence Powell has pointed_out if you exploded oneHiroshima sized bomb for every person alive on earth today you would still be about a billion bombsshort of the size of the KT impact But even that alone may not have been enough to wipe out percent of Earth's life dinosaurs included The KT meteor had the additional advantage advantage if you are a mammal that is that itlanded in a shallow sea just ten meters deep probably at just the right angle at a time when oxygenlevels were percent higher than at present and so the world was more combustible Above_all thefloor of the sea where it landed was made of rock rich in sulfur The result was an impact that turnedan area of seafloor the size of Belgium into aerosols of sulfuric acid For months afterward the Earthwas subjected to rains acid enough to burn skin In a sense an even greater question than that of what wiped_out percent of the species that wereexisting at the time is how did the remaining percent survive Why was the event so irremediablydevastating to every single dinosaur that existed while other reptiles like snakes and crocodiles passed through unimpeded So far as we can tell no species of toad newt salamander or otheramphibian went extinct in North_America Why should these delicate creatures have emergedunscathed from such an unparalleled disaster asks Tim_Flannery in his fascinating prehistory ofAmerica Eternal_Frontier In the seas it was much the same story All the ammonites vanished but their cousins the nautiloids who lived similar lifestyles swam on Among plankton some species were practically wiped_out percent of foraminiferans for_instance while other organisms like diatoms designed to a similarplan and living alongside were comparatively unscathed These are difficult inconsistencies As Richard_Fortey observes Somehow it does not seemsatisfying just to call them lucky ones' and leave it at that If as seems entirely likely the event wasfollowed by months of dark and choking smoke then many of the insect survivors become difficult toaccount for Some insects like beetles Fortey notes could live on wood or other things lyingaround But what about those like bees that navigate by sunlight and need pollen Explaining theirsurvival isn't so easy Above_all there are the corals Corals require algae to survive and algae require sunlight and bothtogether require steady minimum temperatures Much publicity has been given in the last few years tocorals dying from changes in sea temperature of only a degree or so If they are that vulnerable tosmall changes how did they survive the long impact winter There are also many hard to explain regional variations Extinctions seem to have been far lesssevere in the southern hemisphere than the northern New_Zealand in particular appears to have comethrough largely unscathed even though it had almost no burrowing creatures Even its vegetation wasoverwhelmingly spared and yet the scale of conflagration elsewhere suggests that devastation wasglobal In short there is just a great_deal we_don't_know Some animals absolutely prospered including a little surprisingly the turtles once again AsFlannery notes the period immediately after the dinosaur extinction could well be known as the Ageof Turtles Sixteen species survived in North_America and three more came into existence soon_after Clearly it helped to be at home in water The KT impact wiped_out almost percent of landbased species but only percent of those living in fresh water Water obviously offered protectionagainst heat and flame but also presumably provided more sustenance in the lean period thatfollowed All the land based animals that survived had a habit of retreating to a safer environmentduring times of danger into water or underground either of which would have providedconsiderable shelter against the ravages without Animals that scavenged for a living would also haveenjoyed an advantage Lizards were and are largely impervious to the bacteria in rotting carcasses Indeed often they are positively drawn to it and for a long while there were clearly a lot of putridcarcasses about It is often wrongly stated that only small animals survived the KT event In_fact among thesurvivors were crocodiles which were not just large but three times larger than they are today Buton the whole it is true most of the survivors were small and furtive Indeed with the world dark andhostile it was a perfect time to be small warm blooded nocturnal flexible in diet and cautious bynature the very qualities that distinguished our mammalian forebears Had our evolution been moreadvanced we would probably have been wiped_out Instead mammals found themselves in a worldto which they were as well suited as anything alive However it wasn't as if mammals swarmed forward to fill every niche Evolution may abhor avacuum wrote the paleobiologist Steven M Stanley but it often takes a long time to fill it Forperhaps as many as ten million_years mammals remained cautiously small In the early Tertiary if youwere the size of a bobcat you could be king But once they got going mammals expanded prodigiously sometimes to an almost preposterousdegree For a time there were guinea pigs the size of rhinos and rhinos the size of a two story house Wherever there was a vacancy in the predatory chain mammals rose often literally to fill it Earlymembers of the raccoon family migrated to South_America discovered a vacancy and evolved intocreatures the size and ferocity of bears Birds too prospered disproportionately For millions ofyears a gigantic flightless carnivorous bird called Titanis was possibly the most ferocious creaturein North_America Certainly it was the most daunting bird that ever lived It stood ten feet high weighed over eight hundred pounds and had a beak that could tear the head off pretty much anythingthat irked it Its family survived in formidable fashion for fifty million_years yet until a skeleton wasdiscovered in Florida in we had no idea that it had ever existed Which brings us to another reason for our uncertainty about extinctions the paltriness of the fossilrecord We have touched already on the unlikelihood of any set of bones becoming fossilized but therecord is actually worse than you might think Consider dinosaurs Museums give the impression thatwe have a global abundance of dinosaur fossils In_fact overwhelmingly museum displays areartificial The giant Diplodocus that dominates the entrance hall of the Natural_History_Museum inLondon and has delighted and informed generations of visitors is made of plaster built in inPittsburgh and presented to the museum by Andrew Carnegie The entrance hall of the AmericanMuseum of Natural_History in New_York is dominated by an even grander tableau a skeleton of alarge Barosaurus defending her baby from attack by a darting and toothy Allosaurus It is awonderfully impressive display the Barosaurus rises perhaps thirty feet toward the high ceiling but also entirely fake Every one of the several hundred bones in the display is a cast Visit almost anylarge natural_history museum in the world in Paris Vienna Frankfurt Buenos Aires Mexico City and what will greet you are antique models not ancient bones The fact is we don't really know a great_deal about the dinosaurs For the whole of the Age ofDinosaurs fewer than a thousand species have been identified almost half of them known from asingle specimen which is about a quarter of the number of mammal species alive now Dinosaurs bear in mind ruled the Earth for roughly three times as long as mammals have so either dinosaurswere remarkably unproductive of species or we have barely scratched the surface to use anirresistibly apt clich For millions of years through the Age of Dinosaurs not a single fossil has yet been found Even forthe period of the late Cretaceous the most studied prehistoric period there is thanks to our longinterest in dinosaurs and their extinction some three quarters of all species that lived may yet beundiscovered Animals bulkier than the Diplodocus or more forbidding than tyrannosaurus may haveroamed the Earth in the thousands and we may never know it Until very recently everything knownabout the dinosaurs of this period came from only about three hundred specimens representing justsixteen species The scantiness of the record led to the widespread belief that dinosaurs were on theirway out already when the KT impact occurred In the late_s a paleontologist from the Milwaukee Public Museum Peter Sheehan decided toconduct an experiment Using two hundred volunteers he made a painstaking census of a welldefined but also well picked over area of the famous Hell Creek formation in Montana Siftingmeticulously the volunteers collected every last tooth and vertebra and chip of bone everything thathad been overlooked by previous diggers The work took three years When finished they found thatthey had more than tripled the global total of dinosaur fossils from the late Cretaceous The surveyestablished that dinosaurs remained numerous right up to the time of the KT impact There is noreason to believe that the dinosaurs were dying out gradually during the last three million_years of theCretaceous Sheehan reported We are so used to the notion of our_own inevitability as life's dominant species that it is hard tograsp that we are here only because of timely extraterrestrial bangs and other random flukes The onething we have in common with all other living_things is that for nearly four billion years our ancestorshave managed to slip through a series of closing doors every time we needed them to Stephen JayGould expressed it succinctly in a well known line Humans are here today because our particularline never fractured never once at any of the billion points that could have erased us from history We started this chapter with three points Life wants to be life doesn't always want to be much life from time to time goes extinct To this we may add a fourth Life goes on And often as we shallsee it goes on in ways that are decidedly amazing THE RICHNESS OF BEINGHERE AND THERE in the Natural_History_Museum in London built into recesses along the underlitcorridors or standing between glass cases of minerals and ostrich eggs and a century or so of otherproductive clutter are secret doors at_least secret in the sense that there is nothing about them toattract the visitor's notice Occasionally you might see someone with the distracted manner andinterestingly willful hair that mark the scholar emerge from one of the doors and hasten down acorridor probably to disappear through another door a little further on but this is a relatively rareevent For the most part the doors stay shut giving no hint that beyond them exists another a parallel Natural_History_Museum as vast as and in many ways more wonderful than the one the publicknows and adores The Natural_History_Museum contains some seventy million objects from every realm of life andevery corner of the planet with another hundred thousand or so added to the collection each year butit is really only behind the scenes that you get a sense of what a treasure house this is In cupboardsand cabinets and long rooms full of close packed shelves are kept tens of thousands of pickledanimals in bottles millions of insects pinned to squares of card drawers of shiny mollusks bones ofdinosaurs skulls of early humans endless folders of neatly pressed plants It is a little like wanderingthrough Darwin's brain The spirit room alone holds fifteen miles of shelving containing jar upon jarof animals preserved in methylated spirit Back here are specimens collected by Joseph Banks in Australia Alexander von Humboldt inAmazonia Darwin on the Beagle voyage and much else that is either very rare or historicallyimportant or both Many people would love to get their hands on these things A few actually have In the museum acquired an outstanding ornithological collection from the estate of a devotedcollector named Richard Meinertzhagen author of Birds of Arabia among other scholarly works Meinertzhagen had been a faithful attendee of the museum for years coming almost daily to take notesfor the production of his books and monographs When the crates arrived the curators excitedlyjimmied them open to see what they had been left and were surprised to put it mildly to discover thata very large number of specimens bore the museum's own labels Mr Meinertzhagen it turned_out had been helping himself to their collections for years It also explained his habit of wearing a largeovercoat even during warm weather A few years later a charming old regular in the mollusks department quite a distinguishedgentleman I was told was caught inserting valued seashells into the hollow legs of his Zimmerframe I don't suppose there's anything in here that somebody somewhere doesn't covet Richard Forteysaid with a thoughtful air as he gave me a tour of the beguiling world that is the behind the scenespart of the museum We wandered through a confusion of departments where people sat at large tablesdoing intent investigative things with arthropods and palm fronds and boxes of yellowed bones Everywhere there was an air of unhurried thoroughness of people being engaged in a giganticendeavor that could never be completed and mustn't be rushed In I had read the museum issuedits report on the John Murray Expedition an Indian Ocean survey forty four years after the expeditionhad concluded This is a world where things move at their own pace including a tiny lift Fortey and Ishared with a scholarly looking elderly man with whom Fortey chatted genially and familiarly as weproceeded upwards at about the rate that sediments are laid down When the man departed Fortey said to me That was a very nice chap named Norman who's spentforty two years studying one species of plant St John's wort He retired in but he still comes inevery week How do you spend forty two years on one species of plant I_asked It's remarkable isn't it Fortey agreed He thought for a moment He's very thoroughapparently The lift door opened to reveal a bricked over opening Fortey looked confounded That's very strange he said That used to be Botany back there He punched a button for anotherfloor and we found our way at length to Botany by means of back staircases and discreet trespassthrough yet more departments where investigators toiled lovingly over once living objects And so itwas that I was introduced to Len Ellis and the quiet world of bryophytes mosses to the rest of us When Emerson poetically noted that mosses favor the north sides of trees The moss upon the forestbark was pole star when the night was dark he really meant lichens for in the nineteenth centurymosses and lichens weren't distinguished True mosses aren't actually fussy about where they grow so they are no good as natural compasses In_fact mosses aren't actually much good for anything Perhaps no great group of plants has so few uses commercial or economic as the mosses wroteHenry S Conard perhaps just a touch sadly in How to Know the Mosses and Liverworts publishedin and still to be found on many library shelves as almost the only attempt to popularize thesubject They are however prolific Even with lichens removed bryophytes is a busy realm with over tenthousand species contained within some seven hundred genera The plump and stately Moss Flora ofBritain and Ireland by A J E Smith runs to seven hundred pages and Britain and Ireland are by nomeans outstandingly mossy places The tropics are where you find the variety Len Ellis told_me Aquiet spare man he has been at the Natural_History_Museum for twenty seven years and curator of thedepartment since You can go out into a place like the rain forests of Malaysia and find newvarieties with relative ease I did that myself not long ago I looked down and there was a species thathad never been recorded So we_don't_know how many species are still to be discovered Oh no No idea You might not think there would be that many people in the world prepared to devote lifetimes tothe study of something so inescapably low key but in fact moss people number in the hundreds andthey feel very strongly about their subject Oh yes Ellis told_me the meetings can get very livelyat times I_asked_him for an example of controversy Well here's one inflicted on us by one of your countrymen he said smiling lightly and opened ahefty reference work containing illustrations of mosses whose most notable characteristic to theuninstructed eye was their uncanny similarity one to another That he said tapping a moss used tobe one genus Drepanocladus Now it's been reorganized into three Drepanocladus Wamstorfia and Hamatacoulis And did that lead to blows I_asked perhaps a touch hopefully Well it made sense It made perfect sense But it meant a lot of reordering of collections and itput all the books out of date for a time so there was a bit of you know grumbling Mosses offer mysteries as well he told_me One famous case famous to moss people anyway involved a retiring type called Hyophila stanfordensis which was discovered on the campus ofStanford University in California and later also found growing beside a path in Cornwall on thesouthwest tip of England but has never been encountered anywhere in between How it came to existin two such unconnected locations is anybody's guess It's now known as Hennediellastanfordensis Ellis said Another revision We nodded thoughtfully When a new moss is found it must be compared with all other mosses to make sure that it hasn'tbeen recorded already Then a formal description must be written and illustrations prepared and theresult published in a respectable journal The whole process seldom takes less than six months Thetwentieth century was not a great age for moss taxonomy Much of the century's work was devoted tountangling the confusions and duplications left_behind by the nineteenth_century That was the golden age of moss collecting You may recall that Charles Lyell's father was a greatmoss man One aptly named Englishman George Hunt hunted British mosses so assiduously that heprobably contributed to the extinction of several species But it is thanks to such efforts that LenEllis's collection is one of the world's most comprehensive All of his specimens arepressed into large folded sheets of heavy paper some very old and covered with spidery Victorianscript Some for all we knew might have been in the hand of Robert Brown the great Victorianbotanist unveiler of Brownian motion and the nucleus of cells who founded and ran the museum'sbotany department for its first thirty one years until his death in All the specimens are kept inlustrous old mahogany cabinets so strikingly fine that I remarked upon them Oh those were Sir Joseph Banks's from his house in Soho Square Ellis said casually as ifidentifying a recent purchase from Ikea He had them built to hold his specimens from the Endeavourvoyage He regarded the cabinets thoughtfully as if for the first time in a long while I don't knowhow we ended_up with them in bryology he added This was an amazing disclosure Joseph Banks was England's greatest botanist and the Endeavourvoyage that is the one on which Captain Cook charted the transit of Venus and claimedAustralia for the crown among rather a lot else was the greatest botanical expedition in history Banks paid about million in today's_money to bring himself and a party of nine others anaturalist a secretary three artists and four servants on the three year adventure around the world Goodness knows what the bluff Captain Cook made of such a velvety and pampered assemblage buthe seems to have liked Banks well enough and could not but admire his talents in botany a feelingshared by posterity Never before or since has a botanical party enjoyed greater triumphs Partly it was because thevoyage took in so many new or little known places Tierra del Fuego Tahiti New_Zealand Australia New Guinea but mostly it was because Banks was such an astute and inventive collector Even when unable to go ashore at Rio de Janeiro because of a quarantine he sifted through a bale offodder sent for the ship's livestock and made new discoveries Nothing it seems escaped his notice Altogether he brought back thirty thousand plant specimens including fourteen hundred not seenbefore enough to increase by about a quarter the number of known plants in the world But Banks's grand cache was only part of the total haul in what was an almost absurdly acquisitiveage Plant collecting in the eighteenth_century became a kind of international mania Glory and wealthalike awaited those who could find new species and botanists and adventurers went to the mostincredible lengths to satisfy the world's craving for horticultural novelty Thomas Nuttall the manwho named the wisteria after Caspar Wistar came to America as an uneducated printer butdiscovered a passion for plants and walked halfway across the country and back again collectinghundreds of growing things never seen before John Fraser for whom is named the Fraser fir spentyears in the wilderness collecting on behalf of Catherine the Great and emerged at length to find thatRussia had a new czar who thought he was mad and refused to honor his contract Fraser tookeverything to Chelsea where he opened a nursery and made a handsome living sellingrhododendrons azaleas magnolias Virginia creepers asters and other colonial exotica to adelighted English gentry Huge sums could be made with the right finds John Lyon an amateur botanist spent two hard anddangerous years collecting specimens but cleared almost in today's_money for his efforts Many however just did it for the love of botany Nuttall gave most of what he found to the LiverpoolBotanic Gardens Eventually he became director of Harvard's Botanic Garden and author of theencyclopedic Genera of North American Plants which he not only wrote but also largely typeset And that was just plants There was also all the fauna of the new worlds kangaroos kiwis raccoons bobcats mosquitoes and other curious forms beyond imagining The volume of life onEarth was seemingly infinite as Jonathan Swift noted in some famous lines So naturalists observe a fleaHath smaller fleas that on him prey And these have smaller still to bite 'em And so proceed ad infinitum All this new information needed to be filed ordered and compared with what was known Theworld was desperate for a workable system of classification Fortunately there was a man in Swedenwho stood ready to provide it His name was Carl Linn later changed with permission to the more aristocratic von Linn buthe is remembered now by the Latinized form Carolus Linnaeus He was born in in the village ofR shult in southern Sweden the son of a poor but ambitious Lutheran curate and was such a sluggishstudent that his exasperated father apprenticed him or by some accounts nearly apprenticed him toa cobbler Appalled at the prospect of spending a lifetime banging tacks into leather young Linn begged for another chance which was granted and he never thereafter wavered from academicdistinction He studied medicine in Sweden and Holland though his passion became the naturalworld In the early_s still in his twenties he began to produce catalogues of the world's plantand animal species using a system of his own devising and gradually his fame grew Rarely has a man been more comfortable with his own greatness He spent much of his leisure timepenning long and flattering portraits of himself declaring that there had never been a greater botanistor zoologist and that his system of classification was the greatest achievement in the realm ofscience Modestly he suggested that his gravestone should bear the inscription PrincepsBotanicorum Prince of Botanists It was never wise to question his generous self assessments Those who did so were apt to find they had weeds named after them Linnaeus's other striking quality was an abiding at times one might say a feverish preoccupation with sex He was particularly struck by the similarity between certain bivalves and thefemale pudenda To the parts of one species of clam he gave the names vulva labia pubes anus andhymen He grouped plants by the nature of their reproductive organs and endowed them with anarrestingly anthropomorphic amorousness His descriptions of flowers and their behavior are full ofreferences to promiscuous intercourse barren concubines and the bridal bed In spring hewrote in one oft quoted passage Love comes even to the plants Males and females hold their nuptials showing by theirsexual organs which are males which females The flowers' leaves serve as a bridal bed whichthe Creator has so gloriously arranged adorned with such noble bed curtains and perfumed withso many soft scents that the bridegroom with his bride might there celebrate their nuptials withso much the greater solemnity When the bed has thus been made ready then is the time for thebridegroom to embrace his beloved bride and surrender himself to her He named one genus of plants Clitoria Not surprisingly many people thought him strange But hissystem of classification was irresistible Before Linnaeus plants were given names that wereexpansively descriptive The common ground cherry was called Physalis amno ramosissime ramisangulosis glabris foliis dentoserratis Linnaeus lopped it back to Physalis angulata which name itstill uses The plant world was equally disordered by inconsistencies of naming A botanist could notbe sure if Rosa sylvestris alba cum rubore folio glabro was the same plant that others called Rosasylvestris inodora seu canina Linnaeus solved the puzzlement by calling it simply Rosa canina Tomake these excisions useful and agreeable to all required much more than simply being decisive Itrequired an instinct a genius in fact for spotting the salient qualities of a species The Linnaean system is so well established that we can hardly imagine an alternative but beforeLinnaeus systems of classification were often highly whimsical Animals might be categorized bywhether they were wild or domesticated terrestrial or aquatic large or small even whether theywere thought handsome and noble or of no consequence Buffon arranged his animals by their utilityto man Anatomical considerations barely came into it Linnaeus made it his life's work to rectify thisdeficiency by classifying all that was alive according to its physical attributes Taxonomy which isto say the science of classification has never looked back It all took time of course The first edition of his great Systema Naturae in was just fourteenpages long But it grew and grew until by the twelfth edition the last that Linnaeus would live to see it extended to three volumes and pages In the end he named or recorded some species of plant and animal Other works were more comprehensive John Ray's three volumeHistoria Generalis Plantarum in England completed a generation earlier covered no fewer than species of plants alone but what Linnaeus had that no one else could touch wereconsistency order simplicity and timeliness Though his work dates from the s it didn't becomewidely known in England until the s just in time to make Linnaeus a kind of father figure toBritish naturalists Nowhere was his system embraced with greater enthusiasm which is why for onething the Linnaean Society has its home in London and not Stockholm Linnaeus was not flawless He made room for mythical beasts and monstrous humans whosedescriptions he gullibly accepted from seamen and other imaginative travelers Among these were awild man Homo ferus who walked on all fours and had not yet mastered the art of speech andHomo caudatus man with a tail But then it was as we should not forget an altogether morecredulous age Even the great Joseph Banks took a keen and believing interest in a series of reportedsightings of mermaids off the Scottish coast at the end of the eighteenth_century For the most part however Linnaeus's lapses were offset by sound and often brilliant taxonomy Among otheraccomplishments he saw that whales belonged with cows mice and other common terrestrialanimals in the order Quadrupedia later changed to Mammalia which no one had done before In the beginning Linnaeus intended only to give each plant a genus name and a number Convolvulus Convolvulus and so on but soon realized that that was unsatisfactory and hit onthe binomial arrangement that remains at the heart of the system to this day The intention originallywas to use the binomial system for everything rocks minerals diseases winds whatever existed innature Not everyone embraced the system warmly Many were disturbed by its tendency towardindelicacy which was slightly ironic as before Linnaeus the common names of many plants andanimals had been heartily vulgar The dandelion was long popularly known as the pissabed because of its supposed diuretic properties and other names in everyday use included mare's fart naked ladies twitch ballock hound's piss open arse and bum towel One or two of these earthyappellations may unwittingly survive in English yet The maidenhair in maidenhair moss forinstance does not refer to the hair on the maiden's head At all events it had long been felt that thenatural sciences would be appreciably dignified by a dose of classical renaming so there was acertain dismay in discovering that the self appointed Prince of Botany had sprinkled his texts withsuch designations as Clitoria Fornicata and Vulva Over the years many of these were quietly dropped though not all the common slipper limpet stillanswers on formal occasions to Crepidula fornicata and many other refinements introduced as theneeds of the natural sciences grew more specialized In particular the system was bolstered by thegradual introduction of additional hierarchies Genus plural genera and species had been employedby naturalists for over a hundred years before Linnaeus and order class and family in theirbiological senses all came into use in the s and s But phylum wasn't coined until bythe German Ernst Haeckel and family and order were treated as interchangeable until early in thetwentieth century For a time zoologists used family where botanists placed order to the occasionalconfusion of nearly everyone Linnaeus had divided the animal world into six categories mammals reptiles birds fishes insects and vermes or worms for everything that didn't fit into the first five From the outset it wasevident that putting lobsters and shrimp into the same category as worms was unsatisfactory andvarious new categories such as Mollusca and Crustacea were created Unfortunately these newclassifications were not uniformly applied from nation to nation In an attempt to reestablish order the British in proclaimed a new set of rules called the Stricklandian Code but the French sawthis as highhanded and the Soci t Zoologique countered with its own conflicting code Meanwhile the American Ornithological Society for obscure reasons decided to use the edition of SystemaNaturae as the basis for all its naming rather than the edition used elsewhere which meant thatmany American birds spent the nineteenth_century logged in different genera from their avian cousinsin Europe Not_until at an early meeting of the International Congress of Zoology did naturalistsbegin at last to show a spirit of compromise and adopt a universal code Taxonomy is described sometimes as a science and sometimes as an art but really it's a battleground Even today there is more disorder in the system than most people realize Take the category of thephylum the division that describes the basic body plans of all organisms A few phyla are generallywell known such as mollusks the home of clams and snails arthropods insects and crustaceans and chordates us and all other animals with a backbone or protobackbone though things then moveswiftly in the direction of obscurity Among the latter we might list Gnathostomulida marine worms Cnidaria jellyfish medusae anemones and corals and the delicate Priapulida or little penisworms Familiar or not these are elemental divisions Yet there is surprisingly little agreement onhow many phyla there are or ought to be Most biologists fix the total at about thirty but some opt fora number in the low twenties while Edward_O_Wilson in The Diversity of Life puts the number at asurprisingly robust eighty nine It depends on where you decide to make your divisions whether youare a lumper or a splitter as they say in the biological world At the more workaday level of species the possibilities for disagreements are even greater Whether a species of grass should be called Aegilops incurva Aegilops incurvata or Aegilops ovatamay not be a matter that would stir many nonbotanists to passion but it can be a source of very livelyheat in the right quarters The problem is that there are five thousand species of grass and many ofthem look awfully alike even to people who know grass In consequence some species have beenfound and named at_least twenty times and there are hardly any it appears that haven't beenindependently identified at_least twice The two volume Manual of the Grasses of the United Statesdevotes two hundred closely typeset pages to sorting out all the synonymies as the biological worldrefers to its inadvertent but quite common duplications And that is just for the grasses of a singlecountry To deal with disagreements on the global stage a body known as the International Association forPlant Taxonomy arbitrates on questions of priority and duplication At intervals it hands downdecrees declaring that Zauschneria californica a common plant in rock gardens is to be knownhenceforth as Epilobium canum or that Aglaothamnion tenuissimum may now be regarded asconspecific with Aglaothamnion byssoides but not with Aglaothamnion pseudobyssoides Normallythese are small matters of tidying up that attract little notice but when they touch on beloved gardenplants as they sometimes do shrieks of outrage inevitably follow In the late_s the commonchrysanthemum was banished on apparently sound scientific principles from the genus of the samename and relegated to the comparatively drab and undesirable world of the genus Dendranthema Chrysanthemum breeders are a proud and numerous lot and they protested to the real ifimprobable sounding Committee on Spermatophyta There are also committees for Pteridophyta Bryophyta and Fungi among others all reporting to an executive called the Rapporteur G n ral thisis truly an institution to cherish Although the rules of nomenclature are supposed to be rigidlyapplied botanists are not indifferent to sentiment and in the decision was reversed Similaradjudications have saved petunias euonymus and a popular species of amaryllis from demotion butnot many species of geraniums which some years_ago were transferred amid howls to the genusPelargonium The disputes are entertainingly surveyed in Charles Elliott's The Potting Shed Papers Disputes and reorderings of much the same type can be found in all the other realms of the living so keeping an overall tally is not nearly as straightforward a matter as you might suppose Inconsequence the rather amazing fact is that we don't have the faintest idea not even to the nearestorder of magnitude in the words of Edward_O_Wilson of the number of things that live on ourplanet Estimates range from million to million More extraordinary still according to a reportin the Economist as much as percent of the world's plant and animal species may still awaitdiscovery Of the organisms that we do know about more than in are only sketchily described ascientific name a handful of specimens in a museum and a few scraps of description in scientificjournals is how Wilson describes the state of our knowledge In The Diversity of Life he estimatedthe number of known species of all types plants insects microbes algae everything at million but added that that was just a guess Other authorities have put the number of known speciesslightly higher at around million to million but there is no central registry of these things sonowhere to check numbers In short the remarkable position we find ourselves in is that we don'tactually know what we actually know In principle you ought to be able to go to experts in each area of specialization ask how manyspecies there are in their fields then add the totals Many people have in fact done so The problem isthat seldom do any two come up with matching figures Some sources put the number of known typesof fungi at others at nearly half as many again You can find confident assertionsthat the number of described earthworm species is and equally confident assertions that thefigure is For insects the numbers run from to species These are youunderstand supposedly the known number of species For plants the commonly accepted numbersrange from to That may not seem too vast a discrepancy but it's more than twentytimes the number of flowering plants in the whole of North_America Putting things in order is not the easiest of tasks In the early_s Colin Groves of the AustralianNational University began a systematic survey of the plus known species of primate Oftentimesit turned_out that the same species had been described more than once sometimes several times without any of the discoverers realizing that they were dealing with an animal that was already knownto science It took Groves four decades to untangle everything and that was with a comparativelysmall group of easily distinguished generally noncontroversial creatures Goodness knows what theresults would be if anyone attempted a similar exercise with the planet's estimated types oflichens species of mollusk or plus beetles What is certain is that there is a great_deal of life out there though the actual quantities arenecessarily estimates based on extrapolations sometimes exceedingly expansive extrapolations In awell known exercise in the s Terry Erwin of the Smithsonian Institution saturated a stand ofnineteen rain forest trees in Panama with an insecticide fog then collected everything that fell into hisnets from the canopy Among his haul actually hauls since he repeated the experiment seasonally tomake sure he caught migrant species were types of beetle Based on the distribution of beetleselsewhere the number of other tree species in the forest the number of forests in the world thenumber of other insect types and so on up a long chain of variables he estimated a figure of million species of insects for the entire planet a figure he later said was too conservative Othersusing the same or similar data have come up with figures of million million or millioninsect types underlining the conclusion that however carefully arrived at such figures inevitably oweat least as much to supposition as to science According to the Wall Street Journal the world has about active taxonomists not a greatnumber when you consider how much there is to be recorded But the Journal adds because of thecost about per species and paperwork only about fifteen thousand new species of all typesare logged per year It's not a biodiversity crisis it's a taxonomist crisis barks Koen Maes Belgian born head ofinvertebrates at the Kenyan National Museum in Nairobi whom I met briefly on a visit to the countryin the autumn of There were no specialized taxonomists in the whole of Africa he told_me There was one in the Ivory Coast but I think he has retired he said It takes eight to ten years totrain a taxonomist but none are coming along in Africa They are the real fossils Maes added Hehimself was to be let go at the end of the year he said After seven years in Kenya his contract wasnot being renewed No funds Maes explained Writing in the journal Nature last year the British biologist G H Godfray noted that there is achronic lack of prestige and resources for taxonomists everywhere In consequence many speciesare being described poorly in isolated publications with no attempt to relate a new taxon toexisting species and classifications Moreover much of taxonomists' time is taken up not withdescribing new species but simply with sorting out old ones Many according to Godfray spendmost of their career trying to interpret the work of nineteenth_century systematicists deconstructingtheir often inadequate published descriptions or scouring the world's museums for type material thatis often in very poor condition Godfray particularly stresses the absence of attention being paid tothe systematizing possibilities of the Internet The fact is that taxonomy by and large is still quaintlywedded to paper In an attempt to haul things into the modern age in Kevin Kelly cofounder of Wiredmagazine launched an enterprise called the All Species Foundation with the aim of finding everyliving organism and recording it on a database The cost of such an exercise has been estimated atanywhere from billion to as much as billion As of the spring of the foundation had just million in funds and four full time employees If as the numbers suggest we have perhaps million species of insects yet to find and if our rates of discovery continue at the present pace weshould have a definitive total for insects in a little over fifteen thousand years The rest of the animalkingdom may take a little longer So why do we know as little as we do There are nearly as many reasons as there are animals leftto count but here are a few of the principal causes Most living_things are small and easily overlooked In practical terms this is not always a badthing You might not slumber quite so contentedly if you were aware that your mattress is home toperhaps two million microscopic mites which come out in the wee hours to sup on your sebaceousoils and feast on all those lovely crunchy flakes of skin that you shed as you doze and toss Yourpillow alone may be home to forty thousand of them To them your head is just one large oily bonbon And don't think a clean pillowcase will make a difference To something on the scale of bedmites the weave of the tightest human fabric looks like ship's rigging Indeed if your pillow is sixyears old which is apparently about the average age for a pillow it has been estimated that onetenth of its weight will be made up of sloughed skin living mites dead mites and mite dung toquote the man who did the measuring Dr John Maunder of the British Medical Entomology Center But at_least they are your mites Think of what you snuggle up with each time you climb into a motelbed These mites have been with us since time immemorial but they weren't discovered until If creatures as intimately associated_with us as bed mites escaped our notice until the age of colortelevision it's hardly surprising that most of the rest of the small scale world is barely known to us Go out into a woods any woods at all bend down and scoop up a handful of soil and you will beholding up to billion bacteria most of them unknown to science Your sample will also containperhaps a million plump yeasts some hairy little fungi known as molds perhaps protozoans of which the most familiar is the amoeba and assorted rotifers flatworms roundworms and other microscopic creatures known collectively as cryptozoa A large portion of these will alsobe unknown The most comprehensive handbook of microorganisms Bergey's Manual of SystematicBacteriology lists about types of bacteria In the s a pair of Norwegian scientists JosteinGoks yr and Vigdis Torsvik collected a gram of random soil from a beech forest near their lab inBergen and carefully analyzed its bacterial content They found that this single small samplecontained between and separate bacterial species more than in the whole of Bergey'sManual They then traveled to a coastal location a few miles_away scooped up another gram ofearth and found that it contained to other species As Edward_O_Wilson observes Ifover microbial types exist in two pinches of substrate from two localities in Norway howmany more await discovery in other radically different habitats Well according to one estimate itcould be as high as million We don't look in the right places In The Diversity of Life Wilson describes how one botanistspent a few days tramping around ten hectares of jungle in Borneo and discovered a thousand newspecies of flowering plant more than are found in the whole of North_America The plants weren'thard to find It's just that no one had looked there before Koen Maes of the Kenyan National Museumtold me that he went to one cloud forest as mountaintop forests are known in Kenya and in a halfhour of not particularly dedicated looking found four new species of millipedes three representingnew genera and one new species of tree Big tree he added and shaped his arms as if about todance with a very large partner Cloud forests are found on the tops of plateaus and have sometimesbeen isolated for millions of years They provide the ideal climate for biology and they have hardlybeen studied he said Overall tropical rain forests cover only about percent of Earth's surface but harbor more thanhalf of its animal life and about two_thirds of its flowering plants and most of this life remainsunknown to us because too few researchers spend time in them Not incidentally much of this couldbe quite valuable At least percent of flowering plants have never been tested for their medicinalproperties Because they can't flee from predators plants have had to contrive chemical defenses andso are particularly enriched in intriguing compounds Even now nearly a quarter of all prescribedmedicines are derived from just forty plants with another percent coming from animals ormicrobes so there is a serious risk with every hectare of forest felled of losing medically vitalpossibilities Using a method called combinatorial chemistry chemists can generate forty thousandcompounds at a time in labs but these products are random and not uncommonly useless whereas anynatural molecule will have already passed what the Economist calls the ultimate screeningprogramme over three and a half billion years of evolution Looking for the unknown isn't simply a matter of traveling to remote or distant places however Inhis book Life An Unauthorised Biography Richard_Fortey notes how one ancient bacterium wasfound on the wall of a country pub where men had urinated for generations a discovery that wouldseem to involve rare amounts of luck and devotion and possibly some other quality not specified There aren't enough specialists The stock of things to be found examined and recorded verymuch outruns the supply of scientists available to do it Take the hardy and little known organismsknown as bdelloid rotifers These are microscopic animals that can survive almost anything Whenconditions are tough they curl up into a compact shape switch off their metabolism and wait forbetter times In this state you can drop them into boiling water or freeze them almost to absolute zero that is the level where even atoms give up and when this torment has finished and they arereturned to a more pleasing environment they will uncurl and move on as if nothing has happened Sofar about species have been identified though other sources say but nobody has any idea even remotely how many there may be altogether For years almost all that was known about themwas thanks to the work of a devoted amateur a London clerical worker named David Bryce whostudied them in his spare time They can be found all over the world but you could have all thebdelloid rotifer experts in the world to dinner and not have to borrow plates from the neighbors Even something as important and ubiquitous as fungi and fungi are both attracts comparativelylittle notice Fungi are everywhere and come in many forms as mushrooms molds mildews yeasts and puffballs to name but a sampling and they exist in volumes that most of us little suspect Gathertogether all the fungi found in a typical acre of meadow and you would have pounds of the stuff These are not marginal organisms Without fungi there would be no potato blights Dutch elm disease jock itch or athlete's foot but also no yogurts or beers or cheeses Altogether about species offungi have been identified but it is thought the number could be as high as million A lot ofmycologists work in industry making cheeses and yogurts and the like so it is hard to say how manyare actively involved in research but we can safely take it that there are more species of fungi to befound than there are people to find them The world is a really big place We have been gulled by the ease of air travel and other forms ofcommunication into thinking that the world is not all that big but at ground level where researchersmust work it is actually enormous enormous enough to be full of surprises The okapi the nearestliving relative of the giraffe is now known to exist in substantial numbers in the rain forests of Zaire the total population is estimated at perhaps thirty thousand yet its existence wasn't even suspecteduntil the twentieth_century The large flightless New_Zealand bird called the takahe had beenpresumed extinct for two hundred years before being found living in a rugged area of the country'sSouth Island In a team of French and British scientists in Tibet who were lost in a snowstormin a remote valley came across a breed of horse called the Riwoche that had previously beenknown only from prehistoric cave drawings The valley's inhabitants were astonished to learn that thehorse was considered a rarity in the wider world Some people think even greater surprises may await us A leading British ethno biologist wrotethe Economist in thinks a megatherium a sort of giant ground sloth which may stand as high asa giraffe may lurk in the fastnesses of the Amazon basin Perhaps significantly the ethnobiologistwasn't named perhaps even more significantly nothing more has been heard of him or his giant sloth No one however can categorically say that no such thing is there until every jungly glade has beeninvestigated and we are a long way from achieving that But even if we groomed thousands of fieldworkers and dispatched them to the farthest corners ofthe world it would not be effort enough for wherever life can be it is Life's extraordinary fecundityis amazing even gratifying but also problematic To survey it all you would have to turn over everyrock sift through the litter on every forest floor sieve unimaginable quantities of sand and dirt climbinto every forest canopy and devise much more efficient ways to examine the seas Even then youwould overlook whole ecosystems In the s spelunkers entered a deep cave in Romania that hadbeen sealed off from the outside world for a long but unknown period and found thirty three speciesof insects and other small creatures spiders centipedes lice all blind colorless and new toscience They were living off the microbes in the surface scum of pools which in turn were feedingon hydrogen sulfide from hot springs Our instinct may be to see the impossibility of tracking everything down as frustrating dispiriting perhaps even appalling but it can just as well be viewed as almost unbearably exciting We live on aplanet that has a more or less infinite capacity to surprise What reasoning person could possiblywant it any other way What is nearly always most arresting in any ramble through the scattered disciplines of modernscience is realizing how many people have been willing to devote lifetimes to the most sumptuouslyesoteric lines of inquiry In one of his essays Stephen_Jay Gould notes how a hero of his namedHenry Edward Crampton spent fifty years from to his death in quietly studying a genus ofland snails in Polynesia called Partula Over and over year after year Crampton measured to thetiniest degree to eight decimal places the whorls and arcs and gentle curves of numberlessPartula compiling the results into fastidiously detailed tables A single line of text in a Cramptontable could represent weeks of measurement and calculation Only slightly less devoted and certainly more unexpected was Alfred C Kinsey who becamefamous for his studies of human sexuality in the s and s But before his mind became filledwith sex so to speak Kinsey was an entomologist and a dogged one at that In one expedition lastingtwo years he hiked miles to assemble a collection of wasps How many stings hecollected along the way is not alas recorded Something that had been puzzling me was the question of how you assured a chain of succession inthese arcane fields Clearly there cannot be many institutions in the world that require or are preparedto support specialists in barnacles or Pacific snails As we parted at the Natural_History_Museum inLondon I_asked Richard_Fortey how science ensures that when one person goes there's someoneready to take his place He chuckled rather heartily at my naivet I'm_afraid it's not as if we have substitutes sitting on thebench somewhere waiting to be called in to play When a specialist retires or even moreunfortunately dies that can bring a stop to things in that field sometimes for a very long while And I suppose that's why you value someone who spends forty two years studying a singlespecies of plant even if it doesn't produce anything terribly new Precisely he said precisely And he really seemed to mean it CELLSIT STARTS WITH a single cell The first cell splits to become two and the two become four and soon After just forty seven doublings you have ten_thousand trillion cells inyour body and are ready to spring forth as a human being And every one of those cells knowsexactly what to do to preserve and nurture you from the moment of conception to your last breath You have no secrets from your cells They know far more about you than you do Each one carriesa copy of the complete genetic code the instruction manual for your_body so it knows not only howto do its job but every other job in the body Never in your life will you have to remind a cell to keepan eye on its adenosine triphosphate levels or to find a place for the extra squirt of folic acid that'sjust unexpectedly turned up It will do that for you and millions more things besides Every cell in nature is a thing of wonder Even the simplest are far beyond the limits of humaningenuity To build the most basic yeast cell for example you would have to miniaturize about thesame number of components as are found in a Boeing jetliner and fit them into a sphere just fivemicrons across then somehow you would have to persuade that sphere to reproduce But yeast cells are as nothing compared with human cells which are not just more varied andcomplicated but vastly more fascinating because of their complex interactions Your cells are a country of ten_thousand trillion citizens each devoted in some intensively specificway to your overall well being There isn't a thing they don't do for you They let you feel pleasureand form thoughts They enable you to stand and stretch and caper When you eat they extract thenutrients distribute the energy and carry off the wastes all those things you learned about in juniorhigh school biology but they also remember to make you hungry in the first place and reward youwith a feeling of well being afterward so that you won't forget to eat again They keep your hairgrowing your ears waxed your brain quietly purring They manage every corner of your being Theywill jump to your defense the instant you are threatened They will unhesitatingly die for you billions of them do so daily And not once in all your years have you thanked even one of them So letus take a moment now to regard them with the wonder and appreciation they deserve We understand a little of how cells do the things they do how they lay down fat or manufactureinsulin or engage in many of the other acts necessary to maintain a complicated entity like yourself but only a little You have at_least different types of protein laboring away inside you and sofar we understand what no more than about percent of them do Others put the figure at more like percent it depends apparently on what you mean by understand Surprises at the cellular level turn up all the time In nature nitric oxide is a formidable toxin and acommon component of air pollution So scientists were naturally a little surprised when in the mid_s they found it being produced in a curiously devoted manner in human cells Its purpose was atfirst a mystery but then scientists began to find it all over the place controlling the flow of bloodand the energy levels of cells attacking cancers and other pathogens regulating the sense of smell even assisting in penile erections It also explained why nitroglycerine the well known explosive soothes the heart pain known as angina It is converted into nitric oxide in the bloodstream relaxingthe muscle linings of vessels allowing blood to flow more freely In barely the space of a decadethis one gassy substance went from extraneous toxin to ubiquitous elixir You possess some few hundred different types of cell according to the Belgian biochemistChristian de_Duve and they vary enormously in size and shape from nerve cells whose filaments canstretch to several feet to tiny disc shaped red blood_cells to the rod shaped photocells that help togive us vision They also come in a sumptuously wide range of sizes nowhere more strikingly thanat the moment of conception when a single beating sperm confronts an egg eighty five thousand timesbigger than it which rather puts the notion of male conquest into perspective On average however a human cell is about twenty microns wide that is about two hundredths of a millimeter which istoo small to be seen but roomy enough to hold thousands of complicated structures like mitochondria and millions_upon millions of molecules In the most literal way cells also vary in liveliness Yourskin cells are all dead It's a somewhat galling notion to reflect that every inch of your surface isdeceased If you are an average sized adult you are lugging around about five pounds of dead skin ofwhich several billion tiny fragments are sloughed off each day Run a finger along a dusty shelf andyou are drawing a pattern very largely in old skin Most living cells seldom last more than a month or so but there are some notable exceptions Livercells can survive for years though the components within them may be renewed every few days Brain cells last as long as you do You are issued a hundred billion or so at birth and that is all youare ever going to get It has been estimated that you lose five hundred of them an_hour so if you haveany serious thinking to do there really isn't a moment to waste The good_news is that the individualcomponents of your brain cells are constantly renewed so that as with the liver cells no part of themis actually likely to be more than about a month old Indeed it has been suggested that there isn't asingle bit of any of us not so much as a stray molecule that was part of us nine years_ago It maynot feel like it but at the cellular level we are all youngsters The first person to describe a cell was Robert Hooke whom we last encountered squabbling withIsaac Newton over credit for the invention of the inverse square law Hooke achieved many things inhis sixty eight years he was both an accomplished theoretician and a dab hand at making ingeniousand useful instruments but nothing he did brought him greater admiration than his popular bookMicrophagia or Some Physiological Descriptions of Miniature Bodies Made by MagnifyingGlasses produced in It revealed to an enchanted public a universe of the very small that wasfar more diverse crowded and finely structured than anyone had ever come close to imagining Among the microscopic features first identified by Hooke were little chambers in plants that hecalled cells because they reminded him of monks' cells Hooke calculated that a one inch square ofcork would contain of these tiny chambers the first appearance of such a very largenumber anywhere in science Microscopes by this time had been around for a generation or so butwhat set Hooke's apart were their technical supremacy They achieved magnifications of thirty times making them the last word in seventeenth century optical technology So it came as something of a shock when just a decade later Hooke and the other members ofLondon's Royal_Society began to receive drawings and reports from an unlettered linen draper inHolland employing magnifications of up to times The draper's name was Antoni vanLeeuwenhoek Though he had little formal education and no background in science he was aperceptive and dedicated observer and a technical genius To this day it is not known how he got such magnificent magnifications from simple handhelddevices which were little more than modest wooden dowels with a tiny bubble of glass embedded inthem far more like magnifying glasses than what most of us think of as microscopes but really notmuch like either Leeuwenhoek made a new instrument for every experiment he performed and wasextremely secretive about his techniques though he did sometimes offer tips to the British on howthey might improve their resolutions Over a period of fifty years beginning remarkably enough when he was already past forty hemade almost two hundred reports to the Royal_Society all written in Low Dutch the only tongue ofwhich he was master Leeuwenhoek offered no interpretations but simply the facts of what he hadfound accompanied by exquisite drawings He sent reports on almost everything that could beusefully examined bread mold a bee's stinger blood_cells teeth hair his own saliva excrement and semen these last with fretful apologies for their unsavory nature nearly all of which had neverbeen seen microscopically before After he reported finding animalcules in a sample of pepper water in the members of theRoyal Society spent a year with the best devices English technology could produce searching for the little animals before finally getting the magnification right What Leeuwenhoek had found wereprotozoa He calculated that there were of these tiny beings in a single drop of water more than the number of people in Holland The world teemed with life in ways and numbers that noone had previously suspected Inspired by Leeuwenhoek's fantastic findings others began to peer into microscopes with suchkeenness that they sometimes found things that weren't in fact there One respected Dutch observer Nicolaus Hartsoecker was convinced he saw tiny preformed men in sperm cells He called thelittle beings homunculi and for some time many people believed that all humans indeed allcreatures were simply vastly inflated versions of tiny but complete precursor beings Leeuwenhoekhimself occasionally got carried away with his enthusiasms In one of his least successful experimentshe tried to study the explosive properties of gunpowder by observing a small blast at close range henearly blinded himself in the process In Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria but that was about as far as progress could get for thenext century and a half because of the limitations of microscope technology Not_until wouldanyone first see the nucleus of a cell it was found by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown thatfrequent but always shadowy visitor to the history of science Brown who lived from to called it nucleus from the Latin nucula meaning little nut or kernel Not_until however didanyone realize that all living matter is cellular It was Theodor Schwann a German who had thisinsight and it was not only comparatively late as scientific insights go but not widely embraced atfirst It wasn't until the s and some landmark work by Louis Pasteur in France that it was shownconclusively that life cannot arise spontaneously but must come from preexisting cells The beliefbecame known as the cell theory and it is the basis of all modern biology The cell has been compared to many things from a complex chemical refinery by the physicistJames Trefil to a vast teeming metropolis the biochemist Guy Brown A cell is both of thosethings and neither It is like a refinery in that it is devoted to chemical activity on a grand scale andlike a metropolis in that it is crowded and busy and filled with interactions that seem confused andrandom but clearly have some system to them But it is a much more nightmarish place than any city orfactory that you have ever seen To begin with there is no up or down inside the cell gravity doesn'tmeaningfully apply at the cellular scale and not an atom's width of space is unused There is activityeverywhere and a ceaseless thrum of electrical energy You may not feel terribly electrical but youare The food we eat and the oxygen we breathe are combined in the cells into electricity The reasonwe don't give each other massive shocks or scorch the sofa when we sit is that it is all happening on atiny scale a mere volts traveling distances measured in nanometers However scale that up and itwould translate as a jolt of twenty million volts per meter about the same as the charge carried by themain body of a thunderstorm Whatever their size or shape nearly all your cells are built to fundamentally the same plan theyhave an outer casing or membrane a nucleus wherein resides the necessary genetic information tokeep you going and a busy space between the two called the cytoplasm The membrane is not asmost of us imagine it a durable rubbery casing something that you would need a sharp pin to prick Rather it is made up of a type of fatty material known as a lipid which has the approximateconsistency of a light grade of machine oil to quote Sherwin B Nuland If that seems surprisinglyinsubstantial bear in mind that at the microscopic level things behave differently To anything on amolecular scale water becomes a kind of heavy duty gel and a lipid is like iron If you could visit a cell you wouldn't like it Blown up to a scale at which atoms were about thesize of peas a cell itself would be a sphere roughly half a mile across and supported by a complexframework of girders called the cytoskeleton Within it millions_upon millions of objects some thesize of basketballs others the size of cars would whiz about like bullets There wouldn't be a placeyou could stand without being pummeled and ripped thousands of times every second from everydirection Even for its full time occupants the inside of a cell is a hazardous place Each strand ofDNA is on average attacked or damaged once every seconds ten_thousand times in a day bychemicals and other agents that whack into or carelessly slice through it and each of these woundsmust be swiftly stitched up if the cell is not to perish The proteins are especially lively spinning pulsating and flying into each other up to a billiontimes a second Enzymes themselves a type of protein dash everywhere performing up to a thousandtasks a second Like greatly speeded up worker ants they busily build and rebuild molecules haulinga piece off this one adding a piece to that one Some monitor passing proteins and mark with achemical those that are irreparably damaged or flawed Once so selected the doomed proteinsproceed to a structure called a proteasome where they are stripped down and their components usedto build new proteins Some types of protein exist for less than half an_hour others survive for weeks But all lead existences that are inconceivably frenzied As de_Duve notes The molecular world mustnecessarily remain entirely beyond the powers of our imagination owing to the incredible speed withwhich things happen in it But slow things down to a speed at which the interactions can be observed and things don't seemquite so unnerving You can see that a cell is just millions of objects lysosomes endosomes ribosomes ligands peroxisomes proteins of every size and shape bumping into millions of otherobjects and performing mundane tasks extracting energy from nutrients assembling structures gettingrid of waste warding off intruders sending and receiving messages making repairs Typically a cellwill contain some different types of protein and of these about types will each berepresented by at_least molecules This means says Nuland that even if we count onlythose molecules present in amounts of more than each the total is still a very minimum of million protein molecules in each cell Such a staggering figure gives some idea of the swarmingimmensity of biochemical activity within us It is all an immensely demanding process Your heart must pump gallons of blood an_hour gallons every day gallons in a year that's enough to fill four Olympic sizedswimming pools to keep all those cells freshly oxygenated And that's at rest During exercise therate can increase as much as sixfold The oxygen is taken up by the mitochondria These are the cells'power stations and there are about a thousand of them in a typical cell though the number variesconsiderably depending on what a cell does and how much energy it requires You may recall from an earlier chapter that the mitochondria are thought to have originated ascaptive bacteria and that they now live essentially as lodgers in our cells preserving their owngenetic instructions dividing to their own timetable speaking their own language You may alsorecall that we are at the mercy of their goodwill Here's why Virtually all the food and oxygen youtake into your_body are delivered after processing to the mitochondria where they are convertedinto a molecule called adenosine triphosphate or ATP You may not have heard of ATP but it is what keeps you going ATP molecules are essentiallylittle battery packs that move through the cell providing energy for all the cell's processes and you getthrough a lot of it At any given moment a typical cell in your_body will have about one billion ATPmolecules in it and in two minutes every one of them will have been drained dry and another billionwill have taken their place Every_day you produce and use up a volume of ATP equivalent to abouthalf your_body weight Feel the warmth of your skin That's your ATP at work When cells are no_longer needed they die with what can only be called great dignity They takedown all the struts and buttresses that hold them together and quietly devour their component parts The process is known as apoptosis or programmed cell death Every_day billions of your cells die foryour benefit and billions of others clean up the mess Cells can also die violently for_instance wheninfected but mostly they die because they are told to Indeed if not told to live if not given somekind of active instruction from another cell cells automatically kill themselves Cells need a lot ofreassurance When as occasionally happens a cell fails to expire in the prescribed manner but rather begins todivide and proliferate wildly we call the result cancer Cancer cells are really just confused cells Cells make this mistake fairly regularly but the body has elaborate mechanisms for dealing with it Itis only very rarely that the process spirals out of control On average humans suffer one fatalmalignancy for each million billion cell divisions Cancer is bad luck in every possible sense ofthe term The wonder of cells is not that things occasionally go wrong but that they manage everything sosmoothly for decades at a stretch They do so by constantly sending and monitoring streams ofmessages a cacophony of messages from all around the body instructions queries corrections requests for assistance updates notices to divide or expire Most of these signals arrive by means ofcouriers called hormones chemical entities such as insulin adrenaline estrogen and testosterone thatconvey information from remote outposts like the thyroid and endocrine glands Still other messagesarrive by telegraph from the brain or from regional centers in a process called paracrine signaling Finally cells communicate directly with their neighbors to make sure their actions are coordinated What is perhaps most remarkable is that it is all just random frantic action a sequence of endlessencounters directed by nothing more than elemental rules of attraction and repulsion There is clearlyno thinking presence behind any of the actions of the cells It all just happens smoothly andrepeatedly and so reliably that seldom are we even conscious of it yet somehow all this produces notjust order within the cell but a perfect harmony right across the organism In ways that we have barelybegun to understand trillions upon trillions of reflexive chemical reactions add up to a mobile thinking decision making you or come to that a rather less reflective but still incredibly organizeddung beetle Every living thing never forget is a wonder of atomic engineering Indeed some organisms that we think of as primitive enjoy a level of cellular organization thatmakes our_own look carelessly pedestrian Disassemble the cells of a sponge by passing themthrough a sieve for_instance then dump them into a solution and they will find their way backtogether and build themselves into a sponge again You can do this to them over and over and theywill doggedly reassemble because like you and me and every other living thing they have oneoverwhelming impulse to continue to be And that's because of a curious determined barely understood molecule that is itself not alive andfor the most part doesn't do anything at all We call it DNA and to begin to understand its supremeimportance to science and to us we need to go back years or so to Victorian England and to themoment when the naturalist Charles_Darwin had what has been called the single best idea thatanyone has ever had and then for reasons that take a little explaining locked it away in a drawerfor the next fifteen years DARWIN'S SINGULAR NOTIONIN THE LATE summer or early autumn of Whitwell Elwin editor of the respected Britishjournal the Quarterly Review was sent an advance copy of a new book by the naturalist CharlesDarwin Elwin read the book with interest and agreed that it had merit but feared that the subjectmatter was too narrow to attract a wide audience He urged Darwin to write a book about pigeonsinstead Everyone is interested in pigeons he observed helpfully Elwin's sage advice was ignored and On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection orthe Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life was published in late November priced at fifteen shillings The first edition of copies sold out on the first day It has never beenout of print and scarcely out of controversy in all the time since not bad going for a man whoseprincipal other interest was earthworms and who but for a single impetuous decision to sail aroundthe world would very probably have passed his life as an anonymous country parson known for well for an interest in earthworms Charles Robert Darwin was born on February in Shrewsbury a sedate market town inthe west Midlands of England His father was a prosperous and well regarded physician His mother who died when Charles was only eight was the daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of pottery fame Darwin enjoyed every advantage of upbringing but continually pained his widowed father with hislackluster academic performance You care for nothing but shooting dogs and rat catching and youwill be a disgrace to yourself and all your family his father wrote in a line that nearly alwaysappears just about here in any review of Darwin's early life Although his inclination was to naturalhistory for his father's sake he tried to study medicine at Edinburgh University but couldn't bear theblood and suffering The experience of witnessing an operation on an understandably distressed child this was in the days before anesthetics of course left him permanently traumatized He tried lawinstead but found that insupportably dull and finally managed more or less by default to acquire adegree in divinity from Cambridge A life in a rural vicarage seemed to await him when from out of the blue there came a moretempting offer Darwin was invited to sail on the naval survey ship HMS Beagle essentially asdinner company for the captain Robert FitzRoy whose rank precluded his socializing with anyoneother than a gentleman FitzRoy who was very odd chose Darwin in part because he liked the shapeof Darwin's nose It betokened depth of character he believed Darwin was not FitzRoy's firstchoice but got the nod when FitzRoy's preferred companion dropped out From a twenty first centuryperspective the two men's most striking joint feature was their extreme youthfulness At the time ofsailing FitzRoy was only twenty three Darwin just twenty two FitzRoy's formal assignment was to chart coastal waters but his hobby passion really was toseek out evidence for a literal biblical interpretation of creation That Darwin was trained for theministry was central to FitzRoy's decision to have him aboard That Darwin subsequently proved tobe not only liberal of view but less than wholeheartedly devoted to Christian fundamentals became asource of lasting friction between them Darwin's time aboard HMS Beagle from to was obviously the formative experience ofhis life but also one of the most trying He and his captain shared a small cabin which can't havebeen easy as FitzRoy was subject to fits of fury followed by spells of simmering resentment He andDarwin constantly engaged in quarrels some bordering on insanity as Darwin later recalled Ocean voyages tended to become melancholy undertakings at the best of times the previous captainof the Beagle had put a bullet through his brain during a moment of lonely gloom and FitzRoy camefrom a family well known for a depressive instinct His uncle Viscount Castlereagh had slit histhroat the previous decade while serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer FitzRoy would himselfcommit suicide by the same method in Even in his calmer moods FitzRoy proved strangelyunknowable Darwin was astounded to learn upon the conclusion of their voyage that almost at onceFitzRoy married a young woman to whom he had long been betrothed In five years in Darwin'scompany he had not once hinted at an attachment or even mentioned her name In every other respect however the Beagle voyage was a triumph Darwin experienced adventureenough to last a lifetime and accumulated a hoard of specimens sufficient to make his reputation andkeep him occupied for years He found a magnificent trove of giant ancient fossils including the finestMegatherium known to date survived a lethal earthquake in Chile discovered a new species ofdolphin which he dutifully named Delphinus fitzroyi conducted diligent and useful geologicalinvestigations throughout the Andes and developed a new and much admired theory for the formationof coral atolls which suggested not coincidentally that atolls could not form in less than a millionyears the first hint of his long standing attachment to the extreme antiquity of earthly processes In aged twenty seven he returned home after being away for five years and two days He neverleft England again One thing Darwin didn't do on the voyage was propound the theory or even a theory of evolution For a start evolution as a concept was already decades old by the s Darwin's own grandfather Erasmus had paid tribute to evolutionary principles in a poem of inspired mediocrity called TheTemple of Nature years before Charles was even born It wasn't until the younger Darwin was backin England and read Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population which proposed thatincreases in food supply could never keep up with population growth for mathematical reasons thatthe idea began to percolate through his mind that life is a perpetual struggle and that natural selectionwas the means by which some species prospered while others failed Specifically what Darwin sawwas that all organisms competed for resources and those that had some innate advantage wouldprosper and pass on that advantage to their offspring By such means would species continuouslyimprove It seems an awfully simple idea it is an awfully simple idea but it explained a great_deal andDarwin was prepared to devote his life to it How stupid of me not to have thought of it T_H_Huxley cried upon reading On the Origin of Species It is a view that has been echoed ever_since Interestingly Darwin didn't use the phrase survival of the fittest in any of his work though he didexpress his admiration for it The expression was coined five years after the publication of On theOrigin of Species by Herbert Spencer in Principles of Biology in Nor did he employ the wordevolution in print until the sixth edition of Origin by which time its use had become too widespreadto resist preferring instead descent with modification Nor above all were his conclusions in anyway inspired by his noticing during his time in the Gal pagos Islands an interesting diversity in thebeaks of finches The story as conventionally told or at_least as frequently remembered by many ofus is that Darwin while traveling from island to island noticed that the finches' beaks on each islandwere marvelously adapted for exploiting local resources that on one island beaks were sturdy andshort and good for cracking nuts while on the next island beaks were perhaps long and thin and wellsuited for winkling food out of crevices and it was this that set him to thinking that perhaps the birdshad not been created this way but had in a sense created themselves In_fact the birds had created themselves but it wasn't Darwin who noticed it At the time of theBeagle voyage Darwin was fresh out of college and not yet an accomplished naturalist and so failedto see that the Gal pagos birds were all of a type It was his friend the ornithologist John Gould whorealized that what Darwin had found was lots of finches with different talents Unfortunately in hisinexperience Darwin had not noted which birds came from which islands He had made a similarerror with tortoises It took years to sort the muddles out Because of these oversights and the need to sort through crates and crates of other Beaglespecimens it wasn't until six years after his return to England that Darwin finally began tosketch out the rudiments of his new theory These he expanded into a page sketch two yearslater And then he did an extraordinary thing he put his notes away and for the next decade and a halfbusied himself with other matters He fathered ten children devoted nearly eight years to writing anexhaustive opus on barnacles I hate a barnacle as no man ever did before he sighed understandably upon the work's conclusion and fell prey to strange disorders that left himchronically listless faint and flurried as he put it The symptoms nearly always included a terriblenausea and generally also incorporated palpitations migraines exhaustion trembling spots beforethe eyes shortness of breath swimming of the head and not surprisingly depression The cause of the illness has never been established but the most romantic and perhaps likely of themany suggested possibilities is that he suffered from Chagas's disease a lingering tropical maladythat he could have acquired from the bite of a Benchuga bug in South_America A more prosaicexplanation is that his condition was psychosomatic In either case the misery was not Often hecould work for no more than twenty minutes at a stretch sometimes not that Much of the rest of his time was devoted to a series of increasingly desperate treatments icyplunge baths dousings in vinegar draping himself with electric chains that subjected him to smalljolts of current He became something of a hermit seldom leaving his home in Kent Down House One of his first acts upon moving to the house was to erect a mirror outside his study window so thathe could identify and if necessary avoid callers Darwin kept his theory to himself because he well knew the storm it would cause In the yearhe locked his notes away a book called Vestiges of the Natural_History of Creation roused much ofthe thinking world to fury by suggesting that humans might have evolved from lesser primates withoutthe assistance of a divine creator Anticipating the outcry the author had taken careful steps toconceal his identity which he kept a secret from even his closest friends for the next forty years Some wondered if Darwin himself might be the author Others suspected Prince Albert In_fact theauthor was a successful and generally unassuming Scottish publisher named Robert Chambers whosereluctance to reveal himself had a practical dimension as well as a personal one his firm was aleading publisher of Bibles Vestiges was warmly blasted from pulpits throughout Britain and farbeyond but also attracted a good deal of more scholarly ire The Edinburgh Review devoted nearlyan entire issue eighty five pages to pulling it to pieces Even T_H_Huxley a believer inevolution attacked the book with some venom unaware that the author was a friend Darwin's manuscript might have remained locked away till his death but for an alarming blow thatarrived from the Far East in the early summer of in the form of a packet containing a friendlyletter from a young naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace and the draft of a paper On the Tendencyof Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type outlining a theory of natural selectionthat was uncannily similar to Darwin's secret jottings Even some of the phrasing echoed Darwin'sown I never saw a more striking coincidence Darwin reflected in dismay If Wallace had mymanuscript sketch written out in he could not have made a better short abstract Wallace didn't drop into Darwin's life quite as unexpectedly as is sometimes suggested The twowere already corresponding and Wallace had more than once generously sent Darwin specimens thathe thought might be of interest In the process of these exchanges Darwin had discreetly warnedWallace that he regarded the subject of species creation as his own territory This summer will makethe th year since I opened my first note book on the question of how in what way do species varieties differ from each other he had written to Wallace some time earlier I_am nowpreparing my work for publication he added even though he wasn't really In any case Wallace failed to grasp what Darwin was trying to tell him and of course he couldhave no idea that his own theory was so nearly identical to one that Darwin had been evolving as itwere for two decades Darwin was placed in an agonizing quandary If he rushed into print to preserve his priority hewould be taking advantage of an innocent tip off from a distant admirer But if he stepped aside asgentlemanly conduct arguably required he would lose credit for a theory that he had independentlypropounded Wallace's theory was by Wallace's own admission the result of a flash of insight Darwin's was the product of years of careful plodding methodical thought It was all crushinglyunfair To compound his misery Darwin's youngest son also named Charles had contracted scarlet feverand was critically ill At the height of the crisis on June the child died Despite the distraction ofhis son's illness Darwin found time to dash off letters to his friends Charles Lyell and JosephHooker offering to step aside but noting that to do so would mean that all his work whatever it mayamount to will be smashed Lyell and Hooker came up with the compromise solution of presenting asummary of Darwin's and Wallace's ideas together The venue they settled on was a meeting of theLinnaean Society which at the time was struggling to find its way back into fashion as a seat ofscientific eminence On July Darwin's and Wallace's theory was unveiled to the world Darwin himself was not present On the day of the meeting he and his wife were burying their son The Darwin Wallace presentation was one of seven that evening one of the others was on theflora of Angola and if the thirty or so people in the audience had any idea that they were witnessingthe scientific highlight of the century they showed no sign of it No discussion followed Nor did theevent attract much notice elsewhere Darwin cheerfully later noted that only one person a ProfessorHaughton of Dublin mentioned the two papers in print and his conclusion was that all that was newin them was false and what was true was old Wallace still in the distant East learned of these maneuverings long after the event but wasremarkably equable and seemed pleased to have been included at all He even referred to the theoryforever after as Darwinism Much less amenable to Darwin's claim of priority was a Scottishgardener named Patrick Matthew who had rather remarkably also come up with the principles ofnatural selection in fact in the very year that Darwin had set sail in the Beagle Unfortunately Matthew had published these views in a book called Naval Timber and Arboriculture which hadbeen missed not just by Darwin but by the entire world Matthew kicked up in a lively manner with aletter to Gardener's Chronicle when he saw Darwin gaining credit everywhere for an idea thatreally was his Darwin apologized without hesitation though he did note for the record I think thatno one will feel surprised that neither I nor apparently any other naturalist has heard of Mr Matthew's views considering how briefly they are given and they appeared in the Appendix to awork on Naval Timber and Arboriculture Wallace continued for another fifty years as a naturalist and thinker occasionally a very good one but increasingly fell from scientific favor by taking up dubious interests such as spiritualism and thepossibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe So the theory became essentially by default Darwin's alone Darwin never ceased being tormented by his ideas He referred to himself as the Devil'sChaplain and said that revealing the theory felt like confessing a murder Apart from all else heknew it deeply pained his beloved and pious wife Even so he set to work at once expanding hismanuscript into a book length work Provisionally he called it An Abstract of an Essay on the Originof Species and Varieties through Natural Selection a title so tepid and tentative that his publisher John Murray decided to issue just five hundred copies But once presented with the manuscript and aslightly more arresting title Murray reconsidered and increased the initial print run to On the Origin of Species was an immediate commercial success but rather less of a critical one Darwin's theory presented two intractable difficulties It needed far more time than Lord Kelvin waswilling to concede and it was scarcely supported by fossil evidence Where asked Darwin's morethoughtful critics were the transitional forms that his theory so clearly called for If new specieswere continuously evolving then there ought to be lots of intermediate forms scattered across thefossil record but there were not In_fact the record as it existed then and for a long timeafterward showed no life at all right up to the moment of the famous Cambrian_explosion But now here was Darwin without any evidence insisting that the earlier seas must have hadabundant life and that we just hadn't found it yet because for whatever reason it hadn't beenpreserved It simply could not be otherwise Darwin maintained The case at present must remaininexplicable and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained heallowed most candidly but he refused to entertain an alternative possibility By way of explanationhe speculated inventively but incorrectly that perhaps the Precambrian seas had been too clear tolay down sediments and thus had preserved no fossils Even Darwin's closest friends were troubled by the blitheness of some of his assertions AdamSedgwick who had taught Darwin at Cambridge and taken him on a geological tour of Wales in said the book gave him more pain than pleasure Louis Agassiz dismissed it as poor conjecture Even Lyell concluded gloomily Darwin goes too far T_H_Huxley disliked Darwin's insistence on huge_amounts of geological time because he was asaltationist which is to say a believer in the idea that evolutionary changes happen not gradually butsuddenly Saltationists the word comes from the Latin for leap couldn't accept that complicatedorgans could ever emerge in slow stages What good after all is one tenth of a wing or half an eye Such organs they thought only made sense if they appeared in a finished state The belief was surprising in as radical a spirit as Huxley because it closely recalled a veryconservative religious notion first put forward by the English theologian William Paley in andknown as argument from design Paley contended that if you found a pocket watch on the ground evenif you had never seen such a thing before you would instantly perceive that it had been made by anintelligent entity So it was he believed with nature its complexity was proof of its design Thenotion was a powerful one in the nineteenth_century and it gave Darwin trouble too The eye to thisday gives me a cold shudder he acknowledged in a letter to a friend In the Origin he conceded thatit seems I freely confess absurd in the highest possible degree that natural selection could producesuch an instrument in gradual steps Even so and to the unending exasperation of his supporters Darwin not only insisted that allchange was gradual but in nearly every edition of Origin he stepped up the amount of time hesupposed necessary to allow evolution to progress which pushed his ideas increasingly out of favor Eventually according to the scientist and historian Jeffrey Schwartz Darwin lost virtually all thesupport that still remained among the ranks of fellow natural historians and geologists Ironically considering that Darwin called his book On the Origin of Species the one thing hecouldn't explain was how species originated Darwin's theory suggested a mechanism for how aspecies might become stronger or better or faster in a word fitter but gave no indication of how itmight throw up a new species A Scottish engineer Fleeming Jenkin considered the problem andnoted an important flaw in Darwin's argument Darwin believed that any beneficial trait that arose inone generation would be passed on to subsequent generations thus strengthening the species Jenkin pointed_out that a favorable trait in one parent wouldn't become dominant in succeedinggenerations but in fact would be diluted through blending If you pour whiskey into a tumbler ofwater you don't make the whiskey stronger you make it weaker And if you pour that dilute solutioninto another glass of water it becomes weaker still In the same way any favorable trait introducedby one parent would be successively watered down by subsequent matings until it ceased to beapparent at all Thus Darwin's theory was not a recipe for change but for constancy Lucky flukesmight arise from time to time but they would soon vanish under the general impulse to bringeverything back to a stable mediocrity If natural selection were to work some alternative unconsidered mechanism was required Unknown to Darwin and everyone else eight hundred miles_away in a tranquil corner of MiddleEurope a retiring monk named Gregor Mendel was coming up with the solution Mendel was born in to a humble farming family in a backwater of the Austrian empire in what isnow the Czech Republic Schoolbooks once portrayed him as a simple but observant provincial monkwhose discoveries were largely serendipitous the result of noticing some interesting traits ofinheritance while pottering about with pea plants in the monastery's kitchen garden In_fact Mendelwas a trained scientist he had studied physics and mathematics at the Olm tz Philosophical Instituteand the University of Vienna and he brought scientific discipline to all he did Moreover themonastery at Brno where he lived from was known as a learned institution It had a library oftwenty thousand books and a tradition of careful scientific investigation Before embarking on his experiments Mendel spent two years preparing his control specimens seven varieties of pea to make sure they bred true Then helped by two full time assistants herepeatedly bred and crossbred hybrids from thirty thousand pea plants It was delicate work requiring them to take the most exacting pains to avoid accidental cross fertilization and to note everyslight variation in the growth and appearance of seeds pods leaves stems and flowers Mendelknew what he was doing He never used the word gene it wasn't coined until in an English medical dictionary though he did invent the terms dominant and recessive What he established was that every seedcontained two factors or elemente as he called them a dominant one and a recessive one andthese factors when combined produced predictable patterns of inheritance The results he converted into precise mathematical formulae Altogether Mendel spent eight yearson the experiments then confirmed his results with similar experiments on flowers corn and otherplants If anything Mendel was too scientific in his approach for when he presented his findings atthe February and March meetings of the Natural_History Society of Brno in the audience ofabout forty listened politely but was conspicuously unmoved even though the breeding of plants wasa matter of great practical interest to many of the members When Mendel's report was published he eagerly sent a copy to the great Swiss botanist KarlWilhelm von N geli whose support was more or less vital for the theory's prospects Unfortunately N geli failed to perceive the importance of what Mendel had found He suggested that Mendel trybreeding hawkweed Mendel obediently did as N geli suggested but quickly realized that hawkweedhad none of the requisite features for studying heritability It was evident to him that N geli had notread the paper closely or possibly at all Frustrated Mendel retired from investigating heritabilityand spent the rest of his life growing outstanding vegetables and studying bees mice and sunspots among much else Eventually he was made abbot Mendel's findings weren't quite as widely ignored as is sometimes suggested His study received aglowing entry in the Encyclopaedia Britannica then a more leading record of scientific thought thannow and was cited repeatedly in an important paper by the German Wilhelm Olbers Focke Indeed it was because Mendel's ideas never entirely sank below the waterline of scientific thought that theywere so easily recovered when the world was ready for them Together without realizing it Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life sciences inthe twentieth_century Darwin saw that all living_things are connected that ultimately they trace theirancestry to a single common source while Mendel's work provided the mechanism to explain howthat could happen The two men could easily have helped each other Mendel owned a Germanedition of the Origin of Species which he is known to have read so he must have realized theapplicability of his work to Darwin's yet he appears to have made no effort to get in touch AndDarwin for his part is known to have studied Focke's influential paper with its repeated references toMendel's work but didn't connect them to his own studies The one thing everyone thinks featured in Darwin's argument that humans are descended from apes didn't feature at all except as one passing allusion Even so it took no great leap of imagination to seethe implications for human development in Darwin's theories and it became an immediate talkingpoint The showdown came on Saturday June at a meeting of the British Association for theAdvancement of Science in Oxford Huxley had been urged to attend by Robert Chambers author ofVestiges of the Natural_History of Creation though he was still unaware of Chambers's connectionto that contentious tome Darwin as ever was absent The meeting was held at the Oxford ZoologicalMuseum More than a thousand people crowded into the chamber hundreds more were turned away People knew that something big was going to happen though they had first to wait while a slumberinducing speaker named John William Draper of New_York University bravely slogged his waythrough two hours of introductory remarks on The Intellectual Development of Europe Consideredwith Reference to the Views of Mr Darwin Finally the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce rose to speak Wilberforce had been briefed or so it is generally assumed by the ardent anti Darwinian Richard Owen who had been a guest inhis home the night before As nearly always with events that end in uproar accounts vary widely onwhat exactly transpired In the most popular version Wilberforce when properly in flow turned toHuxley with a dry smile and demanded of him whether he claimed attachment to the apes by way ofhis grandmother or grandfather The remark was doubtless intended as a quip but it came across asan icy challenge According to his own account Huxley turned to his neighbor and whispered TheLord hath delivered him into my hands then rose with a certain relish Others however recalled a Huxley trembling with fury and indignation At all events Huxleydeclared that he would rather claim kinship to an ape than to someone who used his eminence topropound uninformed twaddle in what was supposed to be a serious scientific forum Such a ripostewas a scandalous impertinence as well as an insult to Wilberforce's office and the proceedingsinstantly collapsed in tumult A Lady Brewster fainted Robert FitzRoy Darwin's companion on theBeagle twenty_five years before wandered through the hall with a Bible held aloft shouting TheBook the Book He was at the conference to present a paper on storms in his capacity as head ofthe newly created Meteorological Department Interestingly each side afterward claimed to haverouted the other Darwin did eventually make his belief in our kinship with the apes explicit in The Descent of Manin The conclusion was a bold one since nothing in the fossil_record supported such a notion The only known early human remains of that time were the famous Neandertal bones from Germanyand a few uncertain fragments of jawbones and many respected authorities refused to believe even intheir antiquity The Descent of Man was altogether a more controversial book but by the time of itsappearance the world had grown less excitable and its arguments caused much less of a stir For the most part however Darwin passed his twilight years with other projects most of whichtouched only tangentially on questions of natural selection He spent amazingly long periods pickingthrough bird droppings scrutinizing the contents in an attempt to understand how seeds spreadbetween continents and spent years more studying the behavior of worms One of his experimentswas to play the piano to them not to amuse them but to study the effects on them of sound andvibration He was the first to realize how vitally important worms are to soil fertility It may bedoubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history ofthe world he wrote in his masterwork on the subject The Formation of Vegetable Mould Throughthe Action of Worms which was actually more popular than On the Origin of Species hadever been Among his other books were On the Various Contrivances by Which British and ForeignOrchids Are Fertilised by Insects Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals which sold almost copies on its first day The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization in theVegetable Kingdom a subject that came improbably close to Mendel's own work withoutattaining anything like the same insights and his last book The Power of Movement in Plants Finally but not least he devoted much effort to studying the consequences of inbreeding a matter ofprivate interest to him Having married his own cousin Darwin glumly suspected that certain physicaland mental frailties among his children arose from a lack of diversity in his family tree Darwin was often honored in his lifetime but never for On the Origin of Species or Descent ofMan When the Royal_Society bestowed on him the prestigious Copley Medal it was for his geology zoology and botany not evolutionary theories and the Linnaean Society was similarly pleased tohonor Darwin without embracing his radical notions He was never knighted though he was buried inWestminster Abbey next to Newton He died at Down in April Mendel died two years later Darwin's theory didn't really gain widespread acceptance until the s and s with theadvance of a refined theory called with a certain hauteur the Modern Synthesis combining Darwin'sideas with those of Mendel and others For Mendel appreciation was also posthumous though itcame somewhat sooner In three scientists working separately in Europe rediscoveredMendel's work more or less simultaneously It was only because one of them a Dutchman namedHugo de Vries seemed set to claim Mendel's insights as his own that a rival made it noisily clear thatthe credit really lay with the forgotten monk The world was almost ready but not quite to begin to understand how we got here how we madeeach other It is fairly amazing to reflect that at the beginning of the twentieth_century and for someyears beyond the best scientific minds in the world couldn't actually tell you where babies camefrom And these you may recall were men who thought science was nearly at an end THE STUFF OF LIFEIF YOUR TWO parents hadn't bonded just when they did possibly to the second possibly to thenanosecond you wouldn't be here And if their parents hadn't bonded in a precisely timely manner you wouldn't be here either And if their parents hadn't done likewise and their parents before them and so on obviously and indefinitely you wouldn't be here Push backwards through time and these ancestral debts begin to add up Go back just eightgenerations to about the time that Charles_Darwin and Abraham Lincoln were born and already thereare over people on whose timely couplings your existence depends Continue further to the timeof Shakespeare and the Mayflower Pilgrims and you have no fewer than ancestors earnestlyexchanging genetic_material in a way that would eventually and miraculously result in you At twenty generations ago the number of people procreating on your behalf has risen to Five generations before that and there are no fewer than men and women on whosedevoted couplings your existence depends By thirty generations ago your total number of forebears remember these aren't cousins and aunts and other incidental relatives but only parents andparents of parents in a line leading ineluctably to you is over one billion to beprecise If you go back sixty four generations to the time of the Romans the number of people onwhose cooperative efforts your eventual existence depends has risen to approximately which is several thousand times the total number of people who haveever lived Clearly something has gone wrong with our math here The answer it may interest you to learn isthat your line is not pure You couldn't be here without a little incest actually quite a lot of incest albeit at a genetically discreet remove With so many millions of ancestors in your background therewill have been many occasions when a relative from your mother's side of the family procreated withsome distant cousin from your father's side of the ledger In_fact if you are in a partnership now withsomeone from your own race and country the chances are excellent that you are at some level related Indeed if you look around you on a bus or in a park or caf or any crowded place most of the peopleyou see are very probably relatives When someone boasts to you that he is descended from Williamthe Conqueror or the Mayflower Pilgrims you should answer at once Me too In the most literaland fundamental sense we are all family We are also uncannily alike Compare your genes with any other human being's and on average theywill be about percent the same That is what makes us a species The tiny differences in thatremaining percent roughly one nucleotide base in every thousand to quote the Britishgeneticist and recent Nobel laureate John Sulston are what endow us with our individuality Muchhas been made in recent years of the unraveling of the human_genome In_fact there is no such thing as the human_genome Every human_genome is different Otherwise we would all be identical It is theendless recombinations of our genomes each nearly identical but not quite that make us what weare both as individuals and as a species But what exactly is this thing we call the genome And what come to that are genes Well startwith a cell again Inside the cell is a nucleus and inside each nucleus are the chromosomes forty sixlittle bundles of complexity of which twenty three come from your mother and twenty three fromyour father With a very few exceptions every cell in your_body percent of them say carries the same complement of chromosomes The exceptions are red blood_cells some immunesystem cells and egg and sperm cells which for various organizational reasons don't carry the fullgenetic package Chromosomes constitute the complete set of instructions necessary to make andmaintain you and are made of long strands of the little wonder chemical called deoxyribonucleic acidor DNA the most extraordinary molecule on Earth as it has been called DNA exists for just one reason to create more DNA and you have a lot of it inside you aboutsix feet of it squeezed into almost every cell Each length of DNA comprises some billion lettersof coding enough to provide possible combinations guaranteed to be unique against allconceivable odds in the words of Christian de_Duve That's a lot of possibility a one followed bymore than three billion zeroes It would take more than five thousand average size books just to printthat figure notes de_Duve Look at yourself in the mirror and reflect upon the fact that you arebeholding ten_thousand trillion cells and that almost every one of them holds two yards of denselycompacted DNA and you begin to appreciate just how much of this stuff you carry around with you Ifall your DNA were woven into a single fine strand there would be enough of it to stretch from theEarth to the Moon and back not once or twice but again and again Altogether according to onecalculation you may have as much as twenty million kilometers of DNA bundled up inside you Your body in short loves to make DNA and without it you couldn't live Yet DNA is not itselfalive No molecule is but DNA is as it were especially unalive It is among the most nonreactive chemically inert molecules in the living world in the words of the geneticist Richard Lewontin Thatis why it can be recovered from patches of long dried blood or semen in murder investigations andcoaxed from the bones of ancient Neandertals It also explains why it took scientists so long to workout how a substance so mystifyingly low key so in a word lifeless could be at the very heart oflife itself As a known entity DNA has been around longer than you might think It was discovered as far backas by Johann Friedrich Miescher a Swiss scientist working at the University of T bingen inGermany While delving microscopically through the pus in surgical bandages Miescher found asubstance he didn't recognize and called it nuclein because it resided in the nuclei of cells At thetime Miescher did little more than note its existence but nuclein clearly remained on his mind fortwenty three years later in a letter to his uncle he raised the possibility that such molecules could bethe agents behind heredity This was an extraordinary insight but one so far in advance of the day'sscientific requirements that it attracted no attention at all For most of the next half century the common assumption was that the material now calleddeoxyribonucleic acid or DNA had at most a subsidiary role in matters of heredity It was toosimple It had just four basic components called nucleotides which was like having an alphabet ofjust four letters How could you possibly write the story of life with such a rudimentary alphabet The answer is that you do it in much the way that you create complex messages with the simple dotsand dashes of Morse code by combining them DNA didn't do anything at all as far as anyonecould tell It just sat there in the nucleus possibly binding the chromosome in some way or adding asplash of acidity on command or fulfilling some other trivial task that no one had yet thought of Thenecessary complexity it was thought had to exist in proteins in the nucleus There were however two problems with dismissing DNA First there was so much of it twoyards in nearly every nucleus so clearly the cells esteemed it in some important way On top of this it kept turning up like the suspect in a murder mystery in experiments In two studies in particular one involving the Pneumonococcus bacterium and another involving bacteriophages viruses thatinfect bacteria DNA betrayed an importance that could only be explained if its role were morecentral than prevailing thought allowed The evidence suggested that DNA was somehow involved inthe making of proteins a process vital to life yet it was also clear that proteins were being madeoutside the nucleus well away from the DNA that was supposedly directing their assembly No one could understand how DNA could possibly be getting messages to the proteins Theanswer we now know was RNA or ribonucleic acid which acts as an interpreter between the two It is a notable oddity of biology that DNA and proteins don't speak the same language For almost fourbillion years they have been the living world's great double act and yet they answer to mutuallyincompatible codes as if one spoke Spanish and the other Hindi To communicate they need amediator in the form of RNA Working with a kind of chemical clerk called a ribosome RNAtranslates information from a cell's DNA into terms proteins can understand and act upon However by the early_s where we resume our story we were still a very long way fromunderstanding that or indeed almost anything_else to do with the confused business of heredity Clearly there was a need for some inspired and clever experimentation and happily the ageproduced a young person with the diligence and aptitude to undertake it His name was Thomas HuntMorgan and in just four years after the timely rediscovery of Mendel's experiments with peaplants and still almost a decade before gene would even become a word he began to do remarkablydedicated things with chromosomes Chromosomes had been discovered by chance in and were so called because they readilyabsorbed dye and thus were easy to see under the microscope By the turn of the twentieth_century itwas strongly suspected that they were involved in the passing on of traits but no one knew how oreven really whether they did this Morgan chose as his subject of study a tiny delicate fly formally called Drosophila melanogaster but more commonly known as the fruit fly or vinegar fly banana fly or garbage fly Drosophila isfamiliar to most of us as that frail colorless insect that seems to have a compulsive urge to drown inour drinks As laboratory specimens fruit flies had certain very attractive advantages they costalmost nothing to house and feed could be bred by the millions in milk bottles went from egg toproductive parenthood in ten days or less and had just four chromosomes which kept thingsconveniently simple Working out of a small lab which became known inevitably as the Fly Room in SchermerhornHall at Columbia University in New_York Morgan and his team embarked on a program ofmeticulous breeding and crossbreeding involving millions of flies one biographer says billions though that is probably an exaggeration each of which had to be captured with tweezers andexamined under a jeweler's glass for any tiny variations in inheritance For six years they tried toproduce mutations by any means they could think of zapping the flies with radiation and X rays rearing them in bright light and darkness baking them gently in ovens spinning them crazily incentrifuges but nothing worked Morgan was on the brink of giving up when there occurred a suddenand repeatable mutation a fly that had white eyes rather than the usual red ones With thisbreakthrough Morgan and his assistants were able to generate useful deformities allowing them totrack a trait through successive generations By such means they could work out the correlationsbetween particular characteristics and individual chromosomes eventually proving to more or lesseveryone's satisfaction that chromosomes were at the heart of inheritance The problem however remained the next level of biological intricacy the enigmatic genes and theDNA that composed them These were much trickier to isolate and understand As late as whenMorgan was awarded a Nobel_Prize for his work many researchers still weren't convinced that geneseven existed As Morgan noted at the time there was no consensus as to what the genes are whether they are real or purely fictitious It may seem surprising that scientists could struggle toaccept the physical reality of something so fundamental to cellular activity but as Wallace King andSanders point out in Biology The Science of Life that rarest thing a readable college text we arein much the same position today with mental processes such as thought and memory We know that wehave them of course but we_don't_know what if any physical form they take So it was for thelongest time with genes The idea that you could pluck one from your_body and take it away for studywas as absurd to many of Morgan's peers as the idea that scientists today might capture a stray thoughtand examine it under a microscope What was certainly true was that something associated_with chromosomes was directing cellreplication Finally in after fifteen years of effort a team at the Rockefeller Institute inManhattan led by a brilliant but diffident Canadian named Oswald Avery succeeded with anexceedingly tricky experiment in which an innocuous strain of bacteria was made permanentlyinfectious by crossing it with alien DNA proving that DNA was far more than a passive moleculeand almost_certainly was the active agent in heredity The Austrian born biochemist Erwin Chargafflater suggested quite seriously that Avery's discovery was worth two Nobel_Prizes Unfortunately Avery was opposed by one of his own colleagues at the institute a strong willedand disagreeable protein enthusiast named Alfred Mirsky who did everything in his power todiscredit Avery's work including it has been said lobbying the authorities at the KarolinskaInstitute in Stockholm not to give Avery a Nobel_Prize Avery by this time was sixty six years_old andtired Unable to deal with the stress and controversy he resigned his position and never went near alab again But other experiments elsewhere overwhelmingly supported his conclusions and soon therace was on to find the structure of DNA Had you been a betting person in the early_s your money would almost_certainly have been onLinus Pauling of Caltech America's leading chemist to crack the structure of DNA Pauling wasunrivaled in determining the architecture of molecules and had been a pioneer in the field of X raycrystallography a technique that would prove crucial to peering into the heart of DNA In anexceedingly distinguished career he would win two Nobel_Prizes for chemistry in and peacein but with DNA he became convinced that the structure was a triple helix not a double one and never quite got on the right track Instead victory fell to an unlikely quartet of scientists inEngland who didn't work as a team often weren't on speaking terms and were for the most partnovices in the field Of the four the nearest to a conventional boffin was Maurice Wilkins who had spent much of theSecond World_War helping to design the atomic bomb Two of the others Rosalind Franklin andFrancis Crick had passed their war years working on mines for the British government Crick of thetype that blow up Franklin of the type that produce coal The most unconventional of the foursome was James Watson an American prodigy who haddistinguished himself as a boy as a member of a highly popular radio program called The Quiz Kids and thus could claim to be at_least part of the inspiration for some of the members of the Glass familyi n Franny and Zooey and other works by J D Salinger and who had entered the University ofChicago aged just fifteen He had earned his Ph D by the age of twenty two and was now attached tothe famous Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge In he was a gawky twenty three year old witha strikingly lively head of hair that appears in photographs to be straining to attach itself to somepowerful magnet just out of frame Crick twelve years older and still without a doctorate was less memorably hirsute and slightlymore tweedy In Watson's account he is presented as blustery nosy cheerfully argumentative impatient with anyone slow to share a notion and constantly in danger of being asked to goelsewhere Neither was formally trained in biochemistry Their assumption was that if you could determine the shape of a DNA molecule you would be ableto see correctly as it turned_out how it did what it did They hoped to achieve this it wouldappear by doing as little work as possible beyond thinking and no more of that than was absolutelynecessary As Watson cheerfully if a touch disingenuously remarked in his autobiographical bookThe Double Helix It was my hope that the gene might be solved without my learning any chemistry They weren't actually assigned to work on DNA and at one point were ordered to stop it Watsonwas ostensibly mastering the art of crystallography Crick was supposed to be completing a thesis onthe X ray diffraction of large molecules Although Crick and Watson enjoy nearly all the credit in popular accounts for solving the mysteryof DNA their breakthrough was crucially dependent on experimental work done by their competitors the results of which were obtained fortuitously in the tactful words of the historian Lisa Jardine Far ahead of them at_least at the beginning were two academics at King's College in London Wilkins and Franklin The New_Zealand born Wilkins was a retiring figure almost to the point of invisibility A PBS documentary on the discovery of the structure of DNA a feat for which he shared the Nobel_Prize with Crick and Watson managed to overlook him entirely The most enigmatic character of all was Franklin In a severely unflattering portrait Watson in TheDouble Helix depicted Franklin as a woman who was unreasonable secretive chronicallyuncooperative and this seemed especially to irritate him almost willfully unsexy He allowed thatshe was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning had she taken even a mild interest inclothes but in this she disappointed all expectations She didn't even use lipstick he noted inwonder while her dress sense showed all the imagination of English blue stocking adolescents However she did have the best images in existence of the possible structure of DNA achieved bymeans of X ray crystallography the technique perfected by Linus Pauling Crystallography had beenused successfully to map atoms in crystals hence crystallography but DNA molecules were amuch more finicky proposition Only Franklin was managing to get good results from the process butto Wilkins's perennial exasperation she refused to share her findings If Franklin was not warmly forthcoming with her findings she cannot be altogether blamed Femaleacademics at King's in the s were treated with a formalized disdain that dazzles modernsensibilities actually any sensibilities However senior or accomplished they were not allowedinto the college's senior common room but instead had to take their meals in a more utilitarianchamber that even Watson conceded was dingily pokey On top of this she was being constantlypressed at times actively harassed to share her results with a trio of men whose desperation to geta peek at them was seldom matched by more engaging qualities like respect I'm_afraid we alwaysused to adopt let's say a patronizing attitude toward her Crick later recalled Two of these menwere from a competing institution and the third was more or less openly siding with them It shouldhardly come as a surprise that she kept her results locked away That Wilkins and Franklin did not get along was a fact that Watson and Crick seem to haveexploited to their benefit Although Crick and Watson were trespassing rather unashamedly onWilkins's territory it was with them that he increasingly sided not altogether surprisingly sinceFranklin herself was beginning to act in a decidedly queer way Although her results showed thatDNA definitely was helical in shape she insisted to all that it was not To Wilkins's presumeddismay and embarrassment in the summer of she posted a mock notice around the King'sphysics department that said It is with great regret that we have to announce the death on Friday th July of D N A helix It is hoped that Dr M H F Wilkins will speak in memory of thelate helix The outcome of all this was that in January Wilkins showed Watson Franklin's images apparently without her knowledge or consent It would be an understatement to call it a significanthelp Years later Watson conceded that it was the key event it mobilized us Armed with theknowledge of the DNA molecule's basic shape and some important elements of its dimensions Watson and Crick redoubled their efforts Everything now seemed to go their way At one pointPauling was en route to a conference in England at which he would in all likelihood have met withWilkins and learned enough to correct the misconceptions that had put him on the wrong line ofinquiry but this was the McCarthy era and Pauling found himself detained at Idlewild Airport in NewYork his passport confiscated on the grounds that he was too liberal of temperament to be allowedto travel abroad Crick and Watson also had the no less convenient good fortune that Pauling's sonwas working at the Cavendish and innocently kept them abreast of any news of developments andsetbacks at home Still facing the possibility of being trumped at any moment Watson and Crick applied themselvesfeverishly to the problem It was known that DNA had four chemical components called adenine guanine cytosine and thiamine and that these paired up in particular ways By playing with piecesof cardboard cut into the shapes of molecules Watson and Crick were able to work out how thepieces fit together From this they made a Meccano like model perhaps the most famous in modernscience consisting of metal plates bolted together in a spiral and invited Wilkins Franklin and therest of the world to have a look Any informed person could see at once that they had solved theproblem It was without question a brilliant piece of detective work with or without the boost ofFranklin's picture The April edition of Nature carried a word article by Watson and Crick titled AStructure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid Accompanying it were separate articles by Wilkins andFranklin It was an eventful time in the world Edmund Hillary was just about to clamber to the topof Everest while Elizabeth II was imminently to be crowned queen of England so the discovery ofthe secret of life was mostly overlooked It received a small mention in the News Chronicle and wasignored elsewhere Rosalind Franklin did not share in the Nobel_Prize She died of ovarian cancer at the age of justthirty seven in four years before the award was granted Nobel_Prizes are not awardedposthumously The cancer almost_certainly arose as a result of chronic overexposure to X raysthrough her work and needn't have happened In her much praised biography of Franklin Brenda Maddox noted that Franklin rarely wore a lead apron and often stepped carelessly in front ofa beam Oswald Avery never won a Nobel_Prize either and was also largely overlooked by posterity though he did at_least have the satisfaction of living just long enough to see his findings vindicated Hedied in Watson and Crick's discovery wasn't actually confirmed until the s As Crick said in one of hisbooks It took over twenty_five years for our model of DNA to go from being only rather plausible to being very plausible and from there to being virtually certainly correct Even so with the structure of DNA understood progress in genetics was swift and by thejournal Science could run an article titled That Was the Molecular Biology That Was suggesting it hardly seems possible but it is so that the work of genetics was nearly at an end In_fact of course it was only just beginning Even now there is a great_deal about DNA that wescarcely understand not least why so much of it doesn't actually seem to do anything Ninety sevenpercent of your DNA consists of nothing but long stretches of meaningless garble junk or noncoding DNA as biochemists prefer to put it Only here and there along each strand do you findsections that control and organize vital functions These are the curious and long elusive genes Genes are nothing more nor less than instructions to make proteins This they do with a certaindull fidelity In this sense they are rather like the keys of a piano each playing a single note andnothing else which is obviously a trifle monotonous But combine the genes as you would combinepiano keys and you can create chords and melodies of infinite variety Put all these genes together and you have to continue the metaphor the great symphony of existence known as the human_genome An alternative and more common way to regard the genome is as a kind of instruction manual forthe body Viewed this way the chromosomes can be imagined as the book's chapters and the genes asindividual instructions for making proteins The words in which the instructions are written are calledcodons and the letters are known as bases The bases the letters of the genetic alphabet consist ofthe four nucleotides mentioned a page or two back adenine thiamine guanine and cytosine Despitethe importance of what they do these substances are not made of anything exotic Guanine forinstance is the same stuff that abounds in and gives its name to guano The shape of a DNA molecule as everyone knows is rather like a spiral staircase or twisted ropeladder the famous double helix The uprights of this structure are made of a type of sugar calleddeoxyribose and the whole of the helix is a nucleic acid hence the name deoxyribonucleic acid The rungs or steps are formed by two bases joining across the space between and they can combinein only two ways guanine is always paired with cytosine and thiamine always with adenine Theorder in which these letters appear as you move up or down the ladder constitutes the DNA code logging it has been the job of the Human_Genome Project Now the particular brilliance of DNA lies in its manner of replication When it is time to produce anew DNA molecule the two strands part down the middle like the zipper on a jacket and each halfgoes off to form a new partnership Because each nucleotide along a strand pairs up with a specificother nucleotide each strand serves as a template for the creation of a new matching strand If youpossessed just one strand of your own DNA you could easily enough reconstruct the matching side byworking out the necessary partnerships if the topmost rung on one strand was made of guanine thenyou would know that the topmost rung on the matching strand must be cytosine Work your way downthe ladder through all the nucleotide pairings and eventually you would have the code for a newmolecule That is just what happens in nature except that nature does it really quickly in only amatter of seconds which is quite a feat Most of the time our DNA replicates with dutiful accuracy but just occasionally about one timein a million a letter gets into the wrong place This is known as a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP familiarly known to biochemists as a Snip Generally these Snips are buried in stretches ofnoncoding DNA and have no detectable consequence for the body But occasionally they make adifference They might leave you predisposed to some disease but equally they might confer someslight advantage more protective pigmentation for_instance or increased production of red bloodcells for someone living at altitude Over time these slight modifications accumulate in bothindividuals and in populations contributing to the distinctiveness of both The balance between accuracy and errors in replication is a fine one Too many errors and theorganism can't function but too few and it sacrifices adaptability A similar balance must existbetween stability in an organism and innovation An increase in red blood_cells can help a person orgroup living at high elevations to move and breathe more easily because more red cells can carrymore oxygen But additional red cells also thicken the blood Add too many and it's like pumpingoil in the words of Temple University anthropologist Charles Weitz That's hard on the heart Thusthose designed to live at high altitude get increased breathing efficiency but pay for it with higherrisk hearts By such means does Darwinian natural selection look after us It also helps to explainwhy we are all so similar Evolution simply won't let you become too different not withoutbecoming a new species anyway The percent difference between your genes and mine is accounted for by our Snips Now if youcompared your DNA with a third person's there would also be percent correspondence but theSnips would for the most part be in different places Add more people to the comparison and youwill get yet more Snips in yet more places For every one of your billion bases somewhere on theplanet there will be a person or group of persons with different coding in that position So not onlyis it wrong to refer to the human_genome but in a sense we don't even have a human_genome Wehave six billion of them We are all percent the same but equally in the words of the biochemistDavid Cox you could say all humans share nothing and that would be correct too But we have still to explain why so little of that DNA has any discernible purpose It starts to get alittle unnerving but it does really seem that the purpose of life is to perpetuate DNA The percentof our DNA commonly called junk is largely made up of clumps of letters that in Ridley's words exist for the pure and simple reason that they are good at getting themselves duplicated Most ofyour DNA in other words is not devoted to you but to itself you are a machine for reproducing it not it for you Life you will recall just wants to be and DNA is what makes it so Even when DNA includes instructions for making genes when it codes for them as scientists putit it is not necessarily with the smooth functioning of the organism in mind One of the commonestgenes we have is for a protein called reverse transcriptase which has no known beneficial function inhuman beings at all The one thing it does do is make it possible for retroviruses such as the AIDSvirus to slip unnoticed into the human system In other words our bodies devote considerable energies to producing a protein that does nothingthat is beneficial and sometimes clobbers us Our bodies have no choice but to do so because thegenes order it We are vessels for their whims Altogether almost half of human genes the largestproportion yet found in any organism don't do anything at all as far as we can tell except reproducethemselves All organisms are in some sense slaves to their genes That's_why salmon and spiders and othertypes of creatures more or less beyond counting are prepared to die in the process of mating Thedesire to breed to disperse one's genes is the most powerful impulse in nature As Sherwin B Nuland has put it Empires fall ids explode great symphonies are written and behind all of it is asingle instinct that demands satisfaction From an evolutionary point of view sex is really just areward mechanism to encourage us to pass on our genetic_material Scientists had only barely absorbed the surprising news that most of our DNA doesn't do anythingwhen even more unexpected findings began to turn up First in Germany and then in Switzerlandresearchers performed some rather bizarre experiments that produced curiously unbizarre outcomes In one they took the gene that controlled the development of a mouse's eye and inserted it into thelarva of a fruit fly The thought was that it might produce something interestingly grotesque In_fact themouse eye gene not only made a viable eye in the fruit fly it made a fly's eye Here were twocreatures that hadn't shared a common ancestor for million_years yet could swap genetic materialas if they were sisters The story was the same wherever researchers looked They found that they could insert humanDNA into certain cells of flies and the flies would accept it as if it were their own Over percentof human genes it turns_out are fundamentally the same as those found in fruit flies At least percent correlate at some level to those found in mice We even have the same genes for making atail if only they would switch on In field after field researchers found that whatever organism theywere working on whether nematode worms or human_beings they were often studying essentiallythe same genes Life it appeared was drawn up from a single set of blueprints Further probings revealed the existence of a clutch of master control genes each directing thedevelopment of a section of the body which were dubbed homeotic from a Greek_word meaning similar or hox genes Hox genes answered the long bewildering question of how billions ofembryonic cells all arising from a single fertilized egg and carrying identical DNA know where togo and what to do that this one should become a liver cell this one a stretchy neuron this one abubble of blood this one part of the shimmer on a beating wing It is the hox genes that instruct them and they do it for all organisms in much the same way Interestingly the amount of genetic_material and how it is organized doesn't necessarily or evengenerally reflect the level of sophistication of the creature that contains it We have forty sixchromosomes but some ferns have more than six hundred The lungfish one of the least evolved ofall complex animals has forty times as much DNA as we have Even the common newt is moregenetically splendorous than we are by a factor of five Clearly it is not the number of genes you have but what you do with them This is a very good thingbecause the number of genes in humans has taken a big hit lately Until recently it was thought thathumans had at_least genes possibly a good many more but that number was drasticallyreduced by the first results of the Human_Genome Project which suggested a figure more like or genes about the same number as are found in grass That came as both a surprise and adisappointment It won't have escaped your attention that genes have been commonly implicated in any number ofhuman frailties Exultant scientists have at various times declared themselves to have found the genesresponsible for obesity schizophrenia homosexuality criminality violence alcoholism evenshoplifting and homelessness Perhaps the apogee or nadir of this faith in biodeterminism was astudy published in the journal Science in contending that women are genetically inferior atmathematics In_fact we now know almost nothing about you is so accommodatingly simple This is clearly a pity in one important sense for if you had individual genes that determined heightor propensity to diabetes or to baldness or any other distinguishing trait then it would be easy comparatively easy anyway to isolate and tinker with them Unfortunately thirty five thousandgenes functioning independently is not nearly enough to produce the kind of physical complexity thatmakes a satisfactory human being Genes clearly therefore must cooperate A few disorders hemophilia Parkinson's disease Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis for example are causedby lone dysfunctional genes but as a rule disruptive genes are weeded out by natural selection longbefore they can become permanently troublesome to a species or population For the most part ourfate and comfort and even our eye color are determined not by individual genes but by complexesof genes working in alliance That's_why it is so hard to work out how it all fits together and why wewon't be producing designer babies anytime soon In_fact the more we have learned in recent years the more complicated matters have tended tobecome Even thinking it turns_out affects the ways genes work How fast a man's beard grows forinstance is partly a function of how much he thinks about sex because thinking about sex produces atestosterone surge In the early_s scientists made an even more profound discovery when theyfound they could knock out supposedly vital genes from embryonic mice and the mice were not onlyoften born healthy but sometimes were actually fitter than their brothers and sisters who had not beentampered with When certain important genes were destroyed it turned_out others were stepping in tofill the breach This was excellent news for us as organisms but not so good for our_understanding ofhow cells work since it introduced an extra layer of complexity to something that we had barelybegun to understand anyway It is largely because of these complicating factors that cracking the human_genome became seenalmost at once as only a beginning The genome as Eric Lander of MIT has put it is like a parts listfor the human_body it tells us what we are made of but says nothing about how we work What'sneeded now is the operating manual instructions for how to make it go We are not close to thatpoint yet So now the quest is to crack the human proteome a concept so novel that the term proteome didn'teven exist a decade ago The proteome is the library of information that creates proteins Unfortunately observed Scientific_American in the spring of the proteome is much morecomplicated than the genome That's putting it mildly Proteins you will remember are the workhorses of all living systems asmany as a hundred million of them may be busy in any cell at any moment That's a lot of activity totry to figure out Worse proteins' behavior and functions are based not simply on their chemistry aswith genes but also on their shapes To function a protein must not only have the necessary chemicalcomponents properly assembled but then must also be folded into an extremely specific shape Folding is the term that's used but it's a misleading one as it suggests a geometrical tidiness thatdoesn't in fact apply Proteins loop and coil and crinkle into shapes that are at once extravagant andcomplex They are more like furiously mangled coat hangers than folded towels Moreover proteins are if I may be permitted to use a handy archaism the swingers of thebiological world Depending on mood and metabolic circumstance they will allow themselves to bephosphorylated glycosylated acetylated ubiquitinated farneysylated sulfated and linked toglycophosphatidylinositol anchors among rather a lot else Often it takes relatively little to get themgoing it appears Drink a glass of wine as Scientific_American notes and you materially alter thenumber and types of proteins at large in your system This is a pleasant feature for drinkers but notnearly so helpful for geneticists who are trying to understand what is going on It can all begin to seem impossibly complicated and in some ways it is impossibly complicated But there is an underlying simplicity in all this too owing to an equally elemental underlying unity inthe way life works All the tiny deft chemical processes that animate cells the cooperative effortsof nucleotides the transcription of DNA into RNA evolved just once and have stayed pretty wellfixed ever_since across the whole of nature As the late French geneticist Jacques Monod put it onlyhalf in jest Anything that is true of E coli must be true of elephants except more so Every living thing is an elaboration on a single original plan As humans we are mere increments each of us a musty archive of adjustments adaptations modifications and providential tinkeringsstretching back billion years Remarkably we are even quite closely related to fruit andvegetables About half the chemical functions that take place in a banana are fundamentally the sameas the chemical functions that take place in you It cannot be said too often all life is one That is and I suspect will forever prove to be the mostprofound true statement there is PART VI THE ROAD TO US ICE TIMEIN on the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia a handsome and long quiescent mountain namedTambora exploded spectacularly killing a hundred thousand people with its blast and associatedtsunamis It was the biggest volcanic explosion in ten_thousand years times the size of Mount_St Helens equivalent to sixty thousand Hiroshima sized atom bombs News didn't travel terribly fast in those days In London The Times ran a small story actually aletter from a merchant seven months after the event But by this time Tambora's effects were alreadybeing felt Thirty six cubic miles of smoky ash dust and grit had diffused through the atmosphere obscuring the Sun's rays and causing the Earth to cool Sunsets were unusually but blearily colorful an effect memorably captured by the artist J M W Turner who could not have been happier butmostly the world existed under an oppressive dusky pall It was this deathly dimness that inspired theByron lines above Spring never came and summer never warmed became known as the year without summer Crops everywhere failed to grow In Ireland a famine and associated typhoid epidemic killed sixtyfive thousand people In New_England the year became popularly known as Eighteen Hundred andFroze to Death Morning frosts continued until June and almost no planted seed would grow Short offodder livestock died or had to be prematurely slaughtered In every way it was a dreadful year almost_certainly the worst for farmers in modern times Yet globally the temperature fell by onlyabout degrees_Fahrenheit Earth's natural thermostat as scientists would learn is an exceedinglydelicate instrument The nineteenth_century was already a chilly time For two hundred years Europe and NorthAmerica in particular had experienced a Little Ice_Age as it has become known which permitted allkinds of wintry events frost fairs on the Thames ice skating races along Dutch canals that aremostly impossible now It was a period in other words when frigidity was much on people's minds So we may perhaps excuse nineteenth_century geologists for being slow to realize that the world theylived in was in fact balmy compared with former epochs and that much of the land around them hadbeen shaped by crushing glaciers and cold that would wreck even a frost fair They knew there was something odd about the past The European landscape was littered withinexplicable anomalies the bones of arctic reindeer in the warm south of France huge rocksstranded in improbable places and they often came up with inventive but not terribly plausibleexplanations One French naturalist named de Luc trying to explain how granite boulders had come torest high up on the limestone flanks of the Jura Mountains suggested that perhaps they had been shotthere by compressed air in caverns like corks out of a popgun The term for a displaced boulder is anerratic but in the nineteenth_century the expression seemed to apply more often to the theories than tothe rocks The great British geologist Arthur Hallam has suggested that if James Hutton the father of geology had visited Switzerland he would have seen at once the significance of the carved valleys thepolished striations the telltale strand lines where rocks had been dumped and the other abundantclues that point to passing ice_sheets Unfortunately Hutton was not a traveler But even with nothingbetter at his disposal than secondhand accounts Hutton rejected out of hand the idea that hugeboulders had been carried three thousand feet up mountainsides by floods all the water in the worldwon't make a boulder float he pointed_out and became one of the first to argue for widespreadglaciation Unfortunately his ideas escaped notice and for another half century most naturalistscontinued to insist that the gouges on rocks could be attributed to passing carts or even the scrape ofhobnailed boots Local peasants uncontaminated by scientific orthodoxy knew better however The naturalist Jeande Charpentier told the story of how in he was walking along a country lane with a Swisswoodcutter when they got to talking_about the rocks along the roadside The woodcutter matter offactly told him that the boulders had come from the Grimsel a zone of granite some distance away When I_asked_him how he thought that these stones had reached their location he answered withouthesitation The Grimsel glacier transported them on both_sides of the valley because that glacierextended in the past as far as the town of Bern ' Charpentier was delighted He had come to such a view himself but when he raised the notion atscientific gatherings it was dismissed One of Charpentier's closest friends was another Swissnaturalist Louis Agassiz who after some initial skepticism came to embrace and eventually all butappropriate the theory Agassiz had studied under Cuvier in Paris and now held the post of Professor of Natural_History atthe College of Neuch tel in Switzerland Another friend of Agassiz's a botanist named KarlSchimper was actually the first to coin the term ice_age in German Eiszeit in and to proposethat there was good evidence to show that ice had once lain heavily across not just the Swiss Alps but over much of Europe Asia and North_America It was a radical notion He lent Agassiz his notes then came very much to regret it as Agassiz increasingly got the credit for what Schimper felt withsome legitimacy was his theory Charpentier likewise ended_up a bitter enemy of his old friend Alexander von Humboldt yet another friend may have had Agassiz at_least partly in mind when heobserved that there are three stages in scientific discovery first people deny that it is true then theydeny that it is important finally they credit the wrong person At all events Agassiz made the field his own In his quest to understand the dynamics of glaciation he went everywhere deep into dangerous crevasses and up to the summits of the craggiest Alpinepeaks often apparently unaware that he and his team were the first to climb them Nearly everywhereAgassiz encountered an unyielding reluctance to accept his theories Humboldt urged him to return tohis area of real expertise fossil fish and give up this mad obsession with ice but Agassiz was a manpossessed by an idea Agassiz's theory found even less support in Britain where most naturalists had never seen a glacierand often couldn't grasp the crushing forces that ice in bulk exerts Could scratches and polish just bedue to ice asked Roderick Murchison in a mocking tone at one meeting evidently imagining therocks as covered in a kind of light and glassy rime To his dying day he expressed the frankestincredulity at those ice mad geologists who believed that glaciers could account for so much William Hopkins a Cambridge professor and leading member of the Geological_Society endorsedthis view arguing that the notion that ice could transport boulders presented such obviousmechanical absurdities as to make it unworthy of the society's attention Undaunted Agassiz traveled tirelessly to promote his theory In he read a paper to a meetingof the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Glasgow at which he was openlycriticized by the great Charles Lyell The following year the Geological_Society of Edinburgh passeda resolution conceding that there might be some general merit in the theory but that certainly none of itapplied to Scotland Lyell did eventually come round His moment of epiphany came when he realized that a moraine or line of rocks near his family estate in Scotland which he had passed hundreds of times could onlybe understood if one accepted that a glacier had dropped them there But having become converted Lyell then lost his nerve and backed off from public support of the Ice_Age idea It was a frustratingtime for Agassiz His marriage was breaking up Schimper was hotly accusing him of the theft of hisideas Charpentier wouldn't speak to him and the greatest living geologist offered support of only themost tepid and vacillating kind In Agassiz traveled to America to give a series of lectures and there at last found the esteemhe craved Harvard gave him a professorship and built him a first rate museum the Museum ofComparative Zoology Doubtless it helped that he had settled in New_England where the long wintersencouraged a certain sympathy for the idea of interminable periods of cold It also helped that sixyears after his arrival the first scientific expedition to Greenland reported that nearly the whole of thatsemicontinent was covered in an ice_sheet just like the ancient one imagined in Agassiz's theory Atlong last his ideas began to find a real following The one central defect of Agassiz's theory was thathis ice_ages had no cause But assistance was about to come from an unlikely quarter In the s journals and other learned publications in Britain began to receive papers onhydrostatics electricity and other scientific subjects from a James Croll of Anderson's University inGlasgow One of the papers on how variations in Earth's orbit might have precipitated ice_ages waspublished in the Philosophical Magazine in and was recognized at once as a work of thehighest standard So there was some surprise and perhaps just a touch of embarrassment when itturned out that Croll was not an academic at the university but a janitor Born in Croll grew up poor and his formal education lasted only to the age of thirteen Heworked at a variety of jobs as a carpenter insurance salesman keeper of a temperance hotel before taking a position as a janitor at Anderson's now the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow Bysomehow inducing his brother to do much of his work he was able to pass many quiet evenings in theuniversity library teaching himself physics mechanics astronomy hydrostatics and the otherfashionable sciences of the day and gradually began to produce a string of papers with a particularemphasis on the motions of Earth and their effect on climate Croll was the first to suggest that cyclical changes in the shape of Earth's orbit from elliptical which is to say slightly oval to nearly circular to elliptical again might explain the onset and retreatof ice_ages No one had ever thought before to consider an astronomical explanation for variations inEarth's weather Thanks almost entirely to Croll's persuasive theory people in Britain began tobecome more responsive to the notion that at some former time parts of the Earth had been in the gripof ice When his ingenuity and aptitude were recognized Croll was given a job at the GeologicalSurvey of Scotland and widely honored he was made a fellow of the Royal_Society in London and ofthe New_York Academy of Science and given an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews among much else Unfortunately just as Agassiz's theory was at last beginning to find converts in Europe he wasbusy taking it into ever more exotic territory in America He began to find evidence for glacierspractically everywhere he looked including near the equator Eventually he became convinced thatice had once covered the whole Earth extinguishing all life which God had then re created None ofthe evidence Agassiz cited supported such a view Nonetheless in his adopted country his staturegrew and grew until he was regarded as only slightly below a deity When he died in Harvardfelt it necessary to appoint three professors to take his place Yet as sometimes happens his theories fell swiftly out of fashion Less than a decade after hisdeath his successor in the chair of geology at Harvard wrote that the so called glacial epoch sopopular a few years_ago among glacial geologists may now be rejected without hesitation Part of the problem was that Croll's computations suggested that the most recent ice_age occurredeighty thousand years_ago whereas the geological evidence increasingly indicated that Earth hadundergone some sort of dramatic perturbation much more recently than that Without a plausibleexplanation for what might have provoked an ice_age the whole theory fell into abeyance There itmight have remained for some time except that in the early_s a Serbian academic named MilutinMilankovitch who had no background in celestial motions at all he was a mechanical engineer bytraining developed an unexpected interest in the matter Milankovitch realized that the problem withCroll's theory was not that it was incorrect but that it was too simple As Earth moves through space it is subject not just to variations in the length and shape of its orbit but also to rhythmic shifts in its angle of orientation to the Sun its tilt and pitch and wobble allaffecting the length and intensity of sunlight falling on any patch of land In particular it is subject tothree changes in position known formally as its obliquity precession and eccentricity over longperiods of time Milankovitch wondered if there might be a relationship between these complexcycles and the comings and goings of ice_ages The difficulty was that the cycles were of widelydifferent lengths of approximately and years but varying in each case byup to a few thousand years which meant that determining their points of intersection over long spansof time involved a nearly endless amount of devoted computation Essentially Milankovitch had towork out the angle and duration of incoming solar radiation at every latitude on Earth in everyseason for a million_years adjusted for three ever changing variables Happily this was precisely the sort of repetitive toil that suited Milankovitch's temperament Forthe next twenty years even while on vacation he worked ceaselessly with pencil and slide rulecomputing the tables of his cycles work that now could be completed in a day or two with acomputer The calculations all had to be made in his spare time but in Milankovitch suddenlygot a great_deal of that when World_War I broke out and he was arrested owing to his position as areservist in the Serbian army He spent most of the next four years under loose house arrest inBudapest required only to report to the police once a week The rest of his time was spent working inthe library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences He was possibly the happiest prisoner of war inhistory The eventual outcome of his diligent scribblings was the book Mathematical Climatologyand the Astronomical Theory of Climatic Changes Milankovitch was right that there was arelationship between ice_ages and planetary wobble though like most people he assumed that it was agradual increase in harsh winters that led to these long spells of coldness It was a Russian Germanmeteorologist Wladimir K ppen father in law of our tectonic friend Alfred Wegener who sawthat the process was more subtle and rather more unnerving than that The cause of ice_ages K ppen decided is to be found in cool summers not brutal winters Ifsummers are too cool to melt all the snow that falls on a given area more incoming sunlight isbounced back by the reflective surface exacerbating the cooling effect and encouraging yet moresnow to fall The consequence would tend to be self perpetuating As snow accumulated into an icesheet the region would grow cooler prompting more ice to accumulate As the glaciologist GwenSchultz has noted It is not necessarily the amount of snow that causes ice_sheets but the fact thatsnow however little lasts It is thought that an ice_age could start from a single unseasonal summer The leftover snow reflects heat and exacerbates the chilling effect The process is self enlarging unstoppable and once the ice is really growing it moves says McPhee You have advancingglaciers and an ice_age In the s because of imperfect dating technology scientists were unable to correlateMilankovitch's carefully worked out cycles with the supposed dates of ice_ages as then perceived and so Milankovitch and his calculations increasingly fell out of favor He died in unable toprove that his cycles were correct By this time write John and Mary Gribbin you would have beenhard pressed to find a geologist or meteorologist who regarded the model as being anything more thanan historical curiosity Not_until the s and the refinement of a potassium argon method for datingancient seafloor sediments were his theories finally vindicated The Milankovitch cycles alone are not enough to explain cycles of ice_ages Many other factors areinvolved not least the disposition of the continents in particular the presence of landmasses overthe poles but the specifics of these are imperfectly understood It has been suggested however thatif you hauled North_America Eurasia and Greenland just three hundred miles north we would havepermanent and inescapable ice_ages We are very lucky it appears to get any good weather at all Even less well understood are the cycles of comparative balminess within ice_ages known asinterglacials It is mildly unnerving to reflect that the whole of meaningful human history thedevelopment of farming the creation of towns the rise of mathematics and writing and science andall the rest has taken place within an atypical patch of fair weather Previous interglacials havelasted as little as eight thousand years Our own has already passed its ten thousandth anniversary The fact is we are still very much in an ice_age it's just a somewhat shrunken one though lessshrunken than many people realize At the height of the last period of glaciation around twentythousand years_ago about percent of the Earth's land surface was under ice Ten percent still is and a further percent is in a state of permafrost Three quarters of all the fresh water on Earth islocked up in ice even now and we have ice caps at both poles a situation that may be unique inEarth's history That there are snowy winters through much of the world and permanent glaciers evenin temperate places such as New_Zealand may seem quite natural but in fact it is a most unusualsituation for the planet For most of its history until fairly recent times the general pattern for Earth was to be hot with nopermanent ice anywhere The current ice_age ice epoch really started about forty million yearsago and has ranged from murderously bad to not bad at all Ice ages tend to wipe out evidence ofearlier ice_ages so the further back you go the more sketchy the picture grows but it appears that wehave had at_least seventeen severe glacial episodes in the last million_years or so the period thatcoincides with the rise of Homo_erectus in Africa followed by modern_humans Two commonly citedculprits for the present epoch are the rise of the Himalayas and the formation of the Isthmus ofPanama the first disrupting air flows the second ocean currents India once an island has pushedtwo thousand kilometers into the Asian landmass over the last forty five million_years raising notonly the Himalayas but also the vast Tibetan plateau behind them The hypothesis is that the higherlandscape was not only cooler but diverted winds in a way that made them flow north and towardNorth America making it more susceptible to long term chills Then beginning about five millionyears ago Panama rose from the sea closing the gap between North and South_America disruptingthe flows of warming currents between the Pacific and Atlantic and changing patterns of precipitationacross at_least half the world One consequence was a drying out of Africa which caused apes toclimb down out of trees and go looking for a new way of living on the emerging savannas At all events with the oceans and continents arranged as they are now it appears that ice will be along term part of our future According to John McPhee about fifty more glacial episodes can beexpected each lasting a hundred thousand years or so before we can hope for a really long thaw Before fifty million_years_ago Earth had no regular ice_ages but when we did have them they tendedto be colossal A massive freezing occurred about billion_years_ago followed by a billion yearsor so of warmth Then there was another ice_age even larger than the first so large that somescientists are now referring to the age in which it occurred as the Cryogenian or super ice_age Thecondition is more popularly known as Snowball Earth Snowball however barely captures the murderousness of conditions The theory is that becauseof a fall in solar radiation of about percent and a dropoff in the production or retention ofgreenhouse gases Earth essentially lost its ability to hold on to its heat It became a kind of all overAntarctica Temperatures plunged by as much as degrees_Fahrenheit The entire surface of theplanet may have frozen solid with ocean ice up to half a mile thick at higher latitudes and tens ofyards thick even in the tropics There is a serious problem in all this in that the geological evidence indicates ice everywhere including around the equator while the biological evidence suggests just as firmly that there musthave been open water somewhere For one thing cyanobacteria survived the experience and theyphotosynthesize For that they needed sunlight but as you will know if you have ever tried to peerthrough it ice quickly becomes opaque and after only a few yards would pass on no light at all Twopossibilities have been suggested One is that a little ocean water did remain exposed perhapsbecause of some kind of localized warming at a hot_spot the other is that maybe the ice formed insuch a way that it remained translucent a condition that does sometimes happen in nature If Earth did freeze over then there is the very difficult question of how it ever got warm again Anicy planet should reflect so much heat that it would stay frozen forever It appears that rescue mayhave come from our molten interior Once again we may be indebted to tectonics for allowing us tobe here The idea is that we were saved by volcanoes which pushed through the buried surface pumping out lots of heat and gases that melted the snows and re formed the atmosphere Interestingly the end of this hyper frigid episode is marked by the Cambrian outburst the springtime event oflife's history In_fact it may not have been as tranquil as all that As Earth warmed it probably had thewildest weather it has ever experienced with hurricanes powerful enough to raise waves to theheights of skyscrapers and rainfalls of indescribable intensity Throughout all this the tubeworms and clams and other life forms adhering to deep ocean ventsundoubtedly went on as if nothing were amiss but all other life on Earth probably came as close as itever has to checking out entirely It was all a long time ago and at this stage we just don't_know Compared with a Cryogenian outburst the ice_ages of more recent times seem pretty small scale but of course they were immensely grand by the standards of anything to be found on Earth today TheWisconsian ice_sheet which covered much of Europe and North_America was two miles_thick inplaces and marched forward at a rate of about four_hundred feet a year What a thing it must have beento behold Even at their leading edge the ice_sheets could be nearly half a mile thick Imaginestanding at the base of a wall of ice two thousand feet high Behind this edge over an area measuringin the millions of square miles would be nothing but more ice with only a few of the tallest mountainsummits poking through Whole continents sagged under the weight of so much ice and even now twelve thousand years after the glaciers' withdrawal are still rising back into place The ice sheetsdidn't just dribble out boulders and long lines of gravelly moraines but dumped entire landmasses Long Island and Cape Cod and Nantucket among others as they slowly swept along It's littlewonder that geologists before Agassiz had trouble grasping their monumental capacity to reworklandscapes If ice_sheets advanced again we have nothing in our armory that could deflect them In atPrince William Sound in Alaska one of the largest glacial fields in North_America was hit by thestrongest earthquake ever recorded on the continent It measured on the Richter scale Along thefault line the land rose by as much as twenty feet The quake was so violent in fact that it madewater slosh out of pools in Texas And what effect did this unparalleled outburst have on the glaciersof Prince William Sound None at all They just soaked it up and kept on moving For a long time it was thought that we moved into and out of ice_ages gradually over hundreds ofthousands of years but we now know that that has not been the case Thanks to ice cores fromGreenland we have a detailed record of climate for something over a hundred thousand years andwhat is found there is not comforting It shows that for most of its recent history Earth has beennothing like the stable and tranquil place that civilization has known but rather has lurched violentlybetween periods of warmth and brutal chill Toward the end of the last big glaciation some twelve thousand years_ago Earth began to warm and quite rapidly but then abruptly plunged back into bitter cold for a thousand years or so in anevent known to science as the Younger Dryas The name comes from the arctic plant the dryas whichis one of the first to recolonize land after an ice_sheet withdraws There was also an Older Dryasperiod but it wasn't so sharp At the end of this thousand year onslaught average temperatures leaptagain by as much as seven degrees in twenty years which doesn't sound terribly dramatic but isequivalent to exchanging the climate of Scandinavia for that of the Mediterranean in just two decades Locally changes have been even more dramatic Greenland ice cores show the temperatures therechanging by as much as fifteen degrees in ten years drastically altering rainfall patterns and growingconditions This must have been unsettling enough on a thinly populated planet Today theconsequences would be pretty well unimaginable What is most alarming is that we have no idea none what natural phenomena could so swiftlyrattle Earth's thermometer As Elizabeth Kolbert writing in the New_Yorker has observed Noknown external force or even any that has been hypothesized seems capable of yanking thetemperature back and forth as violently and as often as these cores have shown to be the case There seems to be she adds some vast and terrible feedback loop probably involving the oceansand disruptions of the normal patterns of ocean circulation but all this is a long way from beingunderstood One theory is that the heavy inflow of meltwater to the seas at the beginning of the Younger Dryasreduced the saltiness and thus density of northern oceans causing the Gulf Stream to swerve to thesouth like a driver trying to avoid a collision Deprived of the Gulf Stream's warmth the northernlatitudes returned to chilly conditions But this doesn't begin to explain why a thousand years laterwhen the Earth warmed once again the Gulf Stream didn't veer as before Instead we were given theperiod of unusual tranquility known as the Holocene the time in which we live now There is no reason to suppose that this stretch of climatic stability should last much longer In_fact some authorities believe that we are in for even worse than what went before It is natural to supposethat global warming would act as a useful counterweight to the Earth's tendency to plunge back intoglacial conditions However as Kolbert has pointed_out when you are confronted with a fluctuatingand unpredictable climate the last thing you'd want to do is conduct a vast unsupervised experimenton it It has even been suggested with more plausibility than would at first seem evident that an iceage might actually be induced by a rise in temperatures The idea is that a slight warming wouldenhance evaporation rates and increase cloud cover leading in the higher latitudes to more persistentaccumulations of snow In_fact global warming could plausibly if paradoxically lead to powerfullocalized cooling in North_America and northern Europe Climate is the product of so many variables rising and falling carbon_dioxide levels the shifts ofcontinents solar activity the stately wobbles of the Milankovitch cycles that it is as difficult tocomprehend the events of the past as it is to predict those of the future Much is simply beyond us Take Antarctica For at_least twenty million_years after it settled over the South Pole Antarcticaremained covered in plants and free of ice That simply shouldn't have been possible No less intriguing are the known ranges of some late dinosaurs The British geologist StephenDrury notes that forests within degrees latitude of the North Pole were home to great beasts including Tyrannosaurus rex That is bizarre he writes for such a high latitude is continually darkfor three months of the year Moreover there is now evidence that these high latitudes sufferedsevere winters Oxygen isotope studies suggest that the climate around Fairbanks Alaska was aboutthe same in the late Cretaceous period as it is now So what was Tyrannosaurus doing there Either itmigrated seasonally over enormous distances or it spent much of the year in snowdrifts in the dark InAustralia which at that time was more polar in its orientation a retreat to warmer climes wasn'tpossible How dinosaurs managed to survive in such conditions can only be guessed One thought to bear in mind is that if the ice_sheets did start to form again for whatever reason there is a lot more water for them to draw on this time The Great Lakes Hudson Bay the countlesslakes of Canada these weren't there to fuel the last ice_age They were created by it On the other hand the next phase of our history could see us melting a lot of ice rather than makingit If all the ice_sheets melted sea levels would rise by two hundred feet the height of a twenty storybuilding and every coastal city in the world would be inundated More likely at_least in the shortterm is the collapse of the West Antarctic ice_sheet In the past fifty years the waters around it havewarmed by degrees centigrade and collapses have increased dramatically Because of theunderlying geology of the area a large scale collapse is all the more possible If so sea levelsglobally would rise and pretty quickly by between fifteen and twenty feet on average The extraordinary fact is that we_don't_know which is more likely a future offering us eons ofperishing frigidity or one giving us equal expanses of steamy heat Only one thing is certain we liveon a knife edge In the long run incidentally ice_ages are by no means bad_news for the planet They grind up rocksand leave behind new soils of sumptuous richness and gouge out fresh water lakes that provideabundant nutritive possibilities for hundreds of species of being They act as a spur to migration andkeep the planet dynamic As Tim_Flannery has remarked There is only one question you need ask ofa continent in order to determine the fate of its people Did you have a good ice_age ' And with thatin mind it's time to look at a species of ape that truly did THE MYSTERIOUS BIPEDJUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS a young Dutch doctor with an un Dutch name Marie Eug neFran ois Thomas Dubois arrived in Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies with the intention of findingthe earliest human remains on Earth Several things were extraordinary about this To begin with no one had ever gone looking forancient human bones before Everything that had been found to this point had been found accidentally and nothing in Dubois's background suggested that he was the ideal candidate to make the processintentional He was an anatomist by training with no background in paleontology Nor was there anyspecial reason to suppose that the East Indies would hold early human remains Logic dictated that ifancient people were to be found at all it would be on a large and long populated landmass not in thecomparative fastness of an archipelago Dubois was driven to the East Indies on nothing stronger thana hunch the availability of employment and the knowledge that Sumatra was full of caves theenvironment in which most of the important hominid fossils had so far been found What is mostextraordinary in all this nearly miraculous really is that he found what he was looking for At the time Dubois conceived his plan to search for a missing link the human fossil recordconsisted of very little five incomplete Neandertal skeletons one partial jawbone of uncertainprovenance and a half dozen ice_age humans recently found by railway workers in a cave at a cliffcalled Cro Magnon near Les Eyzies France Of the Neandertal specimens the best preserved wassitting unremarked on a shelf in London It had been found by workers blasting rock from a quarry inGibraltar in so its preservation was a wonder but unfortunately no one yet appreciated what itwas After being briefly described at a meeting of the Gibraltar Scientific Society it had been sent tothe Hunterian Museum in London where it remained undisturbed but for an occasional light dustingfor over half a century The first formal description of it wasn't written until and then by ageologist named William Sollas with only a passing competency in anatomy So instead the name and credit for the discovery of the first early humans went to the NeanderValley in Germany not unfittingly as it happens for by uncanny coincidence Neander in Greekmeans new man There in workmen at another quarry in a cliff face overlooking the D sselRiver found some curious looking bones which they passed to a local schoolteacher knowing hehad an interest in all things natural To his great credit the teacher Johann Karl Fuhlrott saw that hehad some new type of human though quite what it was and how special would be matters of disputefor some time Many people refused to accept that the Neandertal bones were ancient at all August Mayer aprofessor at the University of Bonn and a man of influence insisted that the bones were merely thoseof a Mongolian Cossack soldier who had been wounded while fighting in Germany in and hadcrawled into the cave to die Hearing of this T_H_Huxley in England drily observed how remarkableit was that the soldier though mortally wounded had climbed sixty feet up a cliff divested himself ofhis clothing and personal effects sealed the cave opening and buried himself under two feet of soil Another anthropologist puzzling over the Neandertal's heavy brow ridge suggested that it was theresult of long term frowning arising from a poorly healed forearm fracture In their eagerness toreject the idea of earlier humans authorities were often willing to embrace the most singularpossibilities At about the time that Dubois was setting out for Sumatra a skeleton found in P rigueuxwas confidently declared to be that of an Eskimo Quite what an ancient Eskimo was doing insouthwest France was never comfortably explained It was actually an early Cro Magnon It was against this background that Dubois began his search for ancient human bones He did nodigging himself but instead used fifty convicts lent by the Dutch authorities For a year they workedon Sumatra then transferred to Java And there in Dubois or rather his team for Duboishimself seldom visited the sites found a section of ancient human cranium now known as the Trinilskullcap Though only part of a skull it showed that the owner had had distinctly nonhuman featuresbut a much larger brain than any ape Dubois called it Anthropithecus erectus later changed fortechnical reasons to Pithecanthropus erectus and declared it the missing link between apes andhumans It quickly became popularized as Java_Man Today we know it as Homo_erectus The next year Dubois's workers found a virtually complete thighbone that looked surprisinglymodern In_fact many anthropologists think it is modern and has nothing to do with Java_Man If it isan erectus bone it is unlike any other found since Nonetheless Dubois used the thighbone to deduce correctly as it turned_out that Pithecanthropus walked upright He also produced with nothingbut a scrap of cranium and one tooth a model of the complete skull which also proved uncannilyaccurate In Dubois returned to Europe expecting a triumphal reception In_fact he met nearly theopposite reaction Most scientists disliked both his conclusions and the arrogant manner in which hepresented them The skullcap they said was that of an ape probably a gibbon and not of any earlyhuman Hoping to bolster his case in Dubois allowed a respected anatomist from the Universityof Strasbourg Gustav Schwalbe to make a cast of the skullcap To Dubois's dismay Schwalbethereupon produced a monograph that received far more sympathetic attention than anything Duboishad written and followed with a lecture tour in which he was celebrated nearly as warmly as if hehad dug up the skull himself Appalled and embittered Dubois withdrew into an undistinguishedposition as a professor of geology at the University of Amsterdam and for the next two decadesrefused to let anyone examine his precious fossils again He died in an unhappy man Meanwhile and half a world away in late Raymond Dart the Australian born head of anatomyat the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg was sent a small but remarkably completeskull of a child with an intact face a lower jaw and what is known as an endocast a natural cast ofthe brain from a limestone quarry on the edge of the Kalahari Desert at a dusty spot called Taung Dart could see at once that the Taung skull was not of a Homo_erectus like Dubois's Java_Man butfrom an earlier more apelike creature He placed its age at two million_years and dubbed itAustralopithecus africanus or southern ape man of Africa In a report to Nature Dart called theTaung remains amazingly human and suggested the need for an entirely new family Homo simiadae the man apes to accommodate the find The authorities were even less favorably disposed to Dart than they had been to Dubois Nearlyeverything about his theory indeed nearly everything about Dart it appears annoyed them Firsthe had proved himself lamentably presumptuous by conducting the analysis himself rather than callingon the help of more worldly experts in Europe Even his chosen name Australopithecus showed alack of scholarly application combining as it did Greek and Latin roots Above_all his conclusionsflew in the face of accepted wisdom Humans and apes it was agreed had split apart at_least fifteenmillion years_ago in Asia If humans had arisen in Africa why that would make us Negroid forgoodness sake It was rather as if someone working today were to announce that he had found theancestral bones of humans in say Missouri It just didn't fit with what was known Dart's sole supporter of note was Robert Broom a Scottish born physician and paleontologist ofconsiderable intellect and cherishably eccentric nature It was Broom's habit for_instance to do hisfieldwork naked when the weather was warm which was often He was also known for conductingdubious anatomical experiments on his poorer and more tractable patients When the patients died which was also often he would sometimes bury their bodies in his back garden to dig up for studylater Broom was an accomplished paleontologist and since he was also resident in South Africa he wasable to examine the Taung skull at first hand He could see at once that it was as important as Dartsupposed and spoke out vigorously on Dart's behalf but to no effect For the next fifty years thereceived wisdom was that the Taung child was an ape and nothing more Most textbooks didn't evenmention it Dart spent five years working up a monograph but could find no one to publish it Eventually he gave up the quest to publish altogether though he did continue hunting for fossils Foryears the skull today recognized as one of the supreme treasures of anthropology sat as apaperweight on a colleague's desk At the time Dart made his announcement in only four categories of ancient hominid wereknown Homo heidelbergensis Homo rhodesiensis Neandertals and Dubois's Java_Man but allthat was about to change in a very big way First in China a gifted Canadian amateur named Davidson Black began to poke around at a place Dragon Bone Hill that was locally famous as a hunting ground for old bones Unfortunately ratherthan preserving the bones for study the Chinese ground them up to make medicines We can onlyguess how many priceless Homo_erectus bones ended_up as a sort of Chinese equivalent ofbicarbonate of soda The site had been much denuded by the time Black arrived but he found a singlefossilized molar and on the basis of that alone quite brilliantly announced the discovery ofSinanthropus pekinensis which quickly became known as Peking Man At Black's urging more determined excavations were undertaken and many other bones found Unfortunately all were lost the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in when acontingent of U_S Marines trying to spirit the bones and themselves out of the country wasintercepted by the Japanese and imprisoned Seeing that their crates held nothing but bones theJapanese soldiers left them at the roadside It was the last that was ever seen of them In the meantime back on Dubois's old turf of Java a team led by Ralph von Koenigswald hadfound another group of early humans which became known as the Solo People from the site of theirdiscovery on the Solo River at Ngandong Koenigswald's discoveries might have been moreimpressive still but for a tactical error that was realized too late He had offered locals ten cents forevery piece of hominid bone they could come up with then discovered to his horror that they hadbeen enthusiastically smashing large pieces into small ones to maximize their income In the following years as more bones were found and identified there came a flood of new names Homo aurignacensis Australopithecus transvaalensis Paranthropus crassidens Zinjanthropusboisei and scores of others nearly all involving a new genus type as well as a new species By the s the number of named hominid types had risen to comfortably over a hundred To add to theconfusion individual forms often went by a succession of different names as paleoanthropologistsrefined reworked and squabbled over classifications Solo People were known variously as Homosoloensis Homo primigenius asiaticus Homo neanderthalensis soloensis Homo sapienssoloensis Homo_erectus erectus and finally plain Homo_erectus In an attempt to introduce some order in F Clark Howell of the University of Chicago following the suggestions of Ernst Mayr and others the previous decade proposed cutting the numberof genera to just two Australopithecus and Homo and rationalizing many of the species The Javaand Peking men both became Homo_erectus For a time order prevailed in the world of thehominids It didn't last After about a decade of comparative calm paleoanthropology embarked on another period of swiftand prolific discovery which hasn't abated yet The s produced Homo_habilis thought by someto be the missing link between apes and humans but thought by others not to be a separate species atall Then came among many others Homo ergaster Homo louisleakeyi Homo rudolfensis Homomicrocranus and Homo antecessor as well as a raft of australopithecines A afarensis A praegens A ramidus A walkeri A anamensis and still others Altogether some twenty types ofhominid are recognized in the literature today Unfortunately almost no two experts recognize thesame twenty Some continue to observe the two hominid genera suggested by Howell in but others placesome of the australopithecines in a separate genus called Paranthropus and still others add anearlier group called Ardipithecus Some put praegens into Australopithecus and some into a newclassification Homo antiquus but most don't recognize praegens as a separate species at all Thereis no central authority that rules on these things The only way a name becomes accepted is byconsensus and there is often very little of that A big part of the problem paradoxically is a shortage of evidence Since the dawn of time severalbillion human or humanlike beings have lived each contributing a little genetic variability to thetotal human stock Out of this vast number the whole of our_understanding of human prehistory isbased on the remains often exceedingly fragmentary of perhaps five thousand individuals Youcould fit it all into the back of a pickup truck if you didn't mind how much you jumbled everythingup Ian_Tattersall the bearded and friendly curator of anthropology at the American_Museum ofNatural History in New_York replied when I_asked_him the size of the total world archive of hominidand early human bones The shortage wouldn't be so bad if the bones were distributed evenly through time and space but ofcourse they are not They appear randomly often in the most tantalizing fashion Homo erectuswalked the Earth for well over a million_years and inhabited territory from the Atlantic edge ofEurope to the Pacific side of China yet if you brought back to life every Homo_erectus individualwhose existence we can vouch for they wouldn't fill a school bus Homo_habilis consists of evenless just two partial skeletons and a number of isolated limb bones Something as short lived as ourown civilization would almost_certainly not be known from the fossil_record at all In Europe Tattersall offers by way of illustration you've got hominid skulls in Georgia dated toabout million_years_ago but then you have a gap of almost a million_years before the next remainsturn up in Spain right on the other side of the continent and then you've got another year gapbefore you get a Homo heidelbergensis in Germany and none of them looks terribly much like anyof the others He smiled It's from these kinds of fragmentary pieces that you're trying to work outthe histories of entire species It's quite a tall order We really have very little idea of therelationships between many ancient species which led to us and which were evolutionary deadends Some probably don't deserve to be regarded as separate species at all It is the patchiness of the record that makes each new find look so sudden and distinct from all theothers If we had tens of thousands of skeletons distributed at regular intervals through the historicalrecord there would be appreciably more degrees of shading Whole new species don't emergeinstantaneously as the fossil_record implies but gradually out of other existing species The closeryou go back to a point of divergence the closer the similarities are so that it becomes exceedinglydifficult and sometimes impossible to distinguish a late Homo_erectus from an early Homo_sapiens since it is likely to be both and neither Similar disagreements can often arise over questions ofidentification from fragmentary remains deciding for_instance whether a particular bone representsa female Australopithecus boisei or a male Homo_habilis With so little to be certain about scientists often have to make assumptions based on other objectsfound nearby and these may be little more than valiant guesses As Alan Walker and Pat Shipmanhave drily observed if you correlate tool discovery with the species of creature most often foundnearby you would have to conclude that early hand tools were mostly made by antelopes Perhaps nothing better typifies the confusion than the fragmentary bundle of contradictions that wasHomo habilis Simply put habilis bones make no sense When arranged in sequence they showmales and females evolving at different rates and in different directions the males becoming lessapelike and more human with time while females from the same period appear to be moving awayfrom humanness toward greater apeness Some authorities don't believe habilis is a valid category atall Tattersall and his colleague Jeffrey Schwartz dismiss it as a mere wastebasket species oneinto which unrelated fossils could be conveniently swept Even those who see habilis as anindependent species don't agree on whether it is of the same genus as us or is from a side branch thatnever came to anything Finally but perhaps above all human nature is a factor in all this Scientists have a naturaltendency to interpret finds in the way that most flatters their stature It is a rare paleontologist indeedwho announces that he has found a cache of bones but that they are nothing to get excited about Or asJohn Reader understatedly observes in the book Missing Links It is remarkable how often the firstinterpretations of new evidence have confirmed the preconceptions of its discoverer All this leaves ample room for arguments of course and nobody likes to argue more thanpaleoanthropologists And of all the disciplines in science paleoanthropology boasts perhaps thelargest share of egos say the authors of the recent Java_Man a book it may be noted that itselfdevotes long wonderfully unselfconscious passages to attacks on the inadequacies of others inparticular the authors' former close colleague Donald Johanson Here is a small sampling In our years of collaboration at the institute he Johanson developed a well deserved ifunfortunate reputation for unpredictable and high decibel personal verbal assaults sometimesaccompanied by the tossing around of books or whatever else came conveniently to hand So bearing in mind that there is little you can say about human prehistory that won't be disputed bysomeone somewhere other than that we most certainly had one what we think we know about whowe are and where we come from is roughly this For the first percent of our history as organisms we were in the same ancestral line aschimpanzees Virtually nothing is known about the prehistory of chimpanzees but whatever theywere we were Then about seven million_years_ago something major happened A group of newbeings emerged from the tropical forests of Africa and began to move about on the open savanna These were the australopithecines and for the next five million_years they would be the world'sdominant hominid species Austral is from the Latin for southern and has no connection in thiscontext to Australia Australopithecines came in several varieties some slender and gracile likeRaymond Dart's Taung child others more sturdy and robust but all were capable of walking upright Some of these species existed for well over a million_years others for a more modest few hundredthousand but it is worth bearing in mind that even the least successful had histories many times longerthan we have yet achieved The most famous hominid remains in the world are those of a million year oldaustralopithecine found at Hadar in Ethiopia in by a team led by Donald Johanson Formallyknown as A L for Afar Locality the skeleton became more familiarly known as Lucy after the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds Johanson has never doubted her importance She is our earliest ancestor the missing link between ape and human he has said Lucy was tiny just three and a half feet tall She could walk though how well is a matter of somedispute She was evidently a good climber too Much else is unknown Her skull was almost entirelymissing so little could be said with confidence about her brain size though skull fragments suggestedit was small Most books describe Lucy's skeleton as being percent complete though some put itcloser to half and one produced by the American_Museum of Natural_History describes Lucy as twothirds complete The BBC television series Ape Man actually called it a complete skeleton evenwhile showing that it was anything but A human_body has bones but many of these are repeated If you have the left femur from aspecimen you don't need the right to know its dimensions Strip out all the redundant bones and thetotal you are left with is what is called a half skeleton Even by this fairly accommodatingstandard and even counting the slightest fragment as a full bone Lucy constituted only percent of ahalf skeleton and only about percent of a full one In The Wisdom of the Bones Alan Walker recounts how he once asked Johanson how he had comeup with a figure of percent Johanson breezily replied that he had discounted the bones of thehands and feet more than half the body's total and a fairly important half too one would havethought since Lucy's principal defining attribute was the use of those hands and feet to deal with achanging world At all events rather less is known about Lucy than is generally supposed It isn'teven actually known that she was a female Her sex is merely presumed from her diminutive size Two years after Lucy's discovery at Laetoli in Tanzania Mary Leakey found footprints left by twoindividuals from it is thought the same family of hominids The prints had been made when twoaustralopithecines had walked through muddy ash following a volcanic eruption The ash had laterhardened preserving the impressions of their feet for a distance of over twenty three meters The American_Museum of Natural_History in New_York has an absorbing diorama that records themoment of their passing It depicts life sized re creations of a male and a female walking side by sideacross the ancient African plain They are hairy and chimplike in dimensions but have a bearing andgait that suggest humanness The most striking feature of the display is that the male holds his left armprotectively around the female's shoulder It is a tender and affecting gesture suggestive of closebonding The tableau is done with such conviction that it is easy to overlook the consideration that virtuallyeverything above the footprints is imaginary Almost every external aspect of the two figures degreeof hairiness facial appendages whether they had human noses or chimp noses expressions skincolor size and shape of the female's breasts is necessarily suppositional We can't even say thatthey were a couple The female figure may in fact have been a child Nor can we be certain that theywere australopithecines They are assumed to be australopithecines because there are no other knowncandidates I had been told that they were posed like that because during the building of the diorama the femalefigure kept toppling over but Ian_Tattersall insists with a laugh that the story is untrue Obviously wedon't know whether the male had his arm around the female or not but we do know from the stridemeasurements that they were walking side by side and close together close enough to be touching Itwas quite an exposed area so they were probably feeling vulnerable That's_why we tried to givethem slightly worried expressions I_asked_him if he was troubled about the amount of license that was taken in reconstructing thefigures It's always a problem in making re creations he agreed readily enough You wouldn'tbelieve how much discussion can go into deciding details like whether Neandertals had eyebrows ornot It was just the same for the Laetoli figures We simply can't know the details of what they lookedlike but we can convey their size and posture and make some reasonable assumptions about theirprobable appearance If I had it to do again I think I might have made them just slightly more apelikeand less human These creatures weren't humans They were bipedal apes Until very recently it was assumed that we were descended from Lucy and the Laetoli creatures but now many authorities aren't so sure Although certain physical features the teeth for_instance suggest a possible link between us other parts of the australopithecine anatomy are more troubling Intheir book Extinct Humans Tattersall and Schwartz point out that the upper portion of the humanfemur is very like that of the apes but not of the australopithecines so if Lucy is in a direct linebetween apes and modern_humans it means we must have adopted an australopithecine femur for amillion years or so then gone back to an ape femur when we moved on to the next phase of ourdevelopment They believe in fact that not only was Lucy not our ancestor she wasn't even much ofa walker Lucy and her kind did not locomote in anything like the modern human fashion insists Tattersall Only when these hominids had to travel between arboreal habitats would they find themselveswalking bipedally forced' to do so by their own anatomies Johanson doesn't accept this Lucy'ships and the muscular arrangement of her pelvis he has written would have made it as hard for herto climb trees as it is for modern_humans Matters grew murkier still in and when four exceptional new specimens were found One discovered by Meave Leakey of the famous fossil hunting family at Lake Turkana in Kenya andcalled Kenyanthropus platyops Kenyan flat face is from about the same time as Lucy and raisesthe possibility that it was our ancestor and Lucy was an unsuccessful side branch Also found in were Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba dated at between million and million_years old andOrrorin tugenensis thought to be million_years old making it the oldest hominid yet found butonly for a brief while In the summer of a French team working in the Djurab Desert of Chad anarea that had never before yielded ancient bones found a hominid almost million_years old whichthey labeled Sahelanthropus tchadensis Some critics believe that it was not human but an earlyape and therefore should be called Sahelpithecus All these were early creatures and quite primitivebut they walked upright and they were doing so far earlier than previously thought Bipedalism is a demanding and risky strategy It means refashioning the pelvis into a full loadbearing instrument To preserve the required strength the birth canal must be comparatively narrow This has two very significant immediate consequences and one longer term one First it means a lotof pain for any birthing mother and a greatly increased danger of fatality to mother and baby both Moreover to get the baby's head through such a tight space it must be born while its brain is still small and while the baby therefore is still helpless This means long term infant care which in turnimplies solid male female bonding All this is problematic enough when you are the intellectual master of the planet but when you area small vulnerable australopithecine with a brain about the size of an orange the risk must havebeen enormous So why did Lucy and her kind come down from the trees and out of the forests Probably they hadno choice The slow rise of the Isthmus of Panama had cut the flow of waters from the Pacific into theAtlantic diverting warming currents away from the Arctic and leading to the onset of an exceedinglysharp ice_age in northern latitudes In Africa this would have produced seasonal drying and cooling gradually turning jungle into savanna It was not so much that Lucy and her like left the forests JohnGribbin has written but that the forests left them But stepping out onto the open savanna also clearly left the early hominids much more exposed Anupright hominid could see better but could also be seen better Even now as a species we are almostpreposterously vulnerable in the wild Nearly every large animal you can care to name is stronger faster and toothier than us Faced with attack modern_humans have only two advantages We have agood brain with which we can devise strategies and we have hands with which we can fling orbrandish hurtful objects We are the only creature that can harm at a distance We can thus afford to bephysically vulnerable All the elements would appear to have been in place for the rapid evolution of a potent brain andyet that seems not to have happened For over three million_years Lucy and her fellowaustralopithecines scarcely changed at all Their brain didn't grow and there is no sign that they usedeven the simplest tools What is stranger still is that we now know that for about a million_years theylived alongside other early hominids who did use tools yet the australopithecines never tookadvantage of this useful technology that was all around them At one point between three and two million_years_ago it appears there may have been as many assix hominid types coexisting in Africa Only one however was fated to last Homo which emergedfrom the mists beginning about two million_years_ago No one knows quite what the relationship wasbetween australopithecines and Homo but what is known is that they coexisted for something over amillion years before all the australopithecines robust and gracile alike vanished mysteriously andpossibly abruptly over a million_years_ago No one knows why they disappeared Perhaps suggests Matt Ridley we ate them Conventionally the Homo line begins with Homo_habilis a creature about whom we know almostnothing and concludes with us Homo_sapiens literally man the thinker In between anddepending on which opinions you value there have been half a dozen other Homo species Homoergaster Homo neanderthalensis Homo rudolfensis Homo heidelbergensis Homo_erectus andHomo antecessor Homo_habilis handy man was named by Louis Leakey and colleagues in and was socalled because it was the first hominid to use tools albeit very simple ones It was a fairly primitivecreature much more chimpanzee than human but its brain was about percent larger than that ofLucy in gross terms and not much less large proportionally so it was the Einstein of its day Nopersuasive reason has ever been adduced for why hominid brains suddenly began to grow twomillion years_ago For a long time it was assumed that big brains and upright walking were directlyrelated that the movement out of the forests necessitated cunning new strategies that fed off of orpromoted braininess so it was something of a surprise after the repeated discoveries of so manybipedal dullards to realize that there was no apparent connection between them at all There is simply no compelling reason we know of to explain why human brains got large saysTattersall Huge brains are demanding organs they make up only percent of the body's mass butdevour percent of its energy They are also comparatively picky in what they use as fuel If younever ate another morsel of fat your brain would not complain because it won't touch the stuff Itwants glucose instead and lots of it even if it means short changing other organs As Guy Brownnotes The body is in constant danger of being depleted by a greedy brain but cannot afford to let thebrain go hungry as that would rapidly lead to death A big brain needs more food and more foodmeans increased risk Tattersall thinks the rise of a big brain may simply have been an evolutionary accident He believeswith Stephen_Jay Gould that if you replayed the tape of life even if you ran it back only a relativelyshort way to the dawn of hominids the chances are quite unlikely that modern_humans or anythinglike them would be here now One of the hardest ideas for humans to accept he says is that we are not the culmination ofanything There is nothing inevitable about our being here It is part of our vanity as humans that wetend to think of evolution as a process that in effect was programmed to produce us Evenanthropologists tended to think this way right up until the s Indeed as recently as in thepopular textbook The Stages of Evolution C Loring Brace stuck doggedly to the linear concept acknowledging just one evolutionary dead end the robust australopithecines Everything elserepresented a straightforward progression each species of hominid carrying the baton ofdevelopment so far then handing it on to a younger fresher runner Now however it seems certainthat many of these early forms followed side trails that didn't come to anything Luckily for us one did a group of tool users which seemed to arise from out of nowhere andoverlapped with the shadowy and much disputed Homo_habilis This is Homo_erectus the speciesdiscovered by Eug ne Dubois in Java in Depending on which sources you consult it existedfrom about million_years_ago to possibly as recently as twenty thousand or so years_ago According to the Java_Man authors Homo_erectus is the dividing line everything that came beforehim was apelike in character everything that came after was humanlike Homo_erectus was the firstto hunt the first to use fire the first to fashion complex tools the first to leave evidence of campsites the first to look after the weak and frail Compared with all that had gone before Homo_erectus wasextremely human in form as well as behavior its members long limbed and lean very strong muchstronger than modern_humans and with the drive and intelligence to spread successfully over hugeareas To other hominids Homo_erectus must have seemed terrifyingly powerful fleet and gifted Erectus was the velociraptor of its day according to Alan Walker of Penn State University andone of the world's leading authorities If you were to look one in the eyes it might appearsuperficially to be human but you wouldn't connect You'd be prey According to Walker it had thebody of an adult human but the brain of a baby Although erectus had been known about for almost a century it was known only from scatteredfragments not enough to come even close to making one full skeleton So it wasn't until anextraordinary discovery in Africa in the s that its importance or at the very least possibleimportance as a precursor species for modern_humans was fully appreciated The remote valley ofLake Turkana formerly Lake Rudolf in Kenya is now one of the world's most productive sites forearly human remains but for a very long time no one had thought to look there It was only becauseRichard Leakey was on a flight that was diverted over the valley that he realized it might be morepromising than had been thought A team was dispatched to investigate but at first found nothing Then late one afternoon Kamoya Kimeu Leakey's most renowned fossil hunter found a small piece ofhominid brow on a hill well away from the lake Such a site was unlikely to yield much but they duganyway out of respect for Kimeu's instincts and to their astonishment found a nearly complete Homoerectus skeleton It was from a boy aged between about nine and twelve who had died millionyears ago The skeleton had an entirely modern body structure says Tattersall in a way that waswithout precedent The Turkana boy was very emphatically one of us Also found at Lake Turkana by Kimeu was KNM ER a female million_years old whichgave scientists their first clue that Homo_erectus was more interesting and complex than previouslythought The woman's bones were deformed and covered in coarse growths the result of an agonizingcondition called hypervitaminosis A which can come only from eating the liver of a carnivore Thistold us first of all that Homo_erectus was eating meat Even more surprising was that the amount ofgrowth showed that she had lived weeks or even months with the disease Someone had looked afterher It was the first sign of tenderness in hominid evolution It was also discovered that Homo_erectus skulls contained or in the view of some possiblycontained a Broca's area a region of the frontal lobe of the brain associated_with speech Chimpsdon't have such a feature Alan Walker thinks the spinal canal didn't have the size and complexity toenable speech that they probably would have communicated about as well as modern chimps Others notably Richard Leakey are convinced they could speak For a time it appears Homo_erectus was the only hominid species on Earth It was hugelyadventurous and spread across the globe with what seems to have been breathtaking rapidity Thefossil evidence if taken literally suggests that some members of the species reached Java at about thesame time as or even slightly before they left Africa This has led some hopeful scientists to suggestthat perhaps modern people arose not in Africa at all but in Asia which would be remarkable notto say miraculous as no possible precursor species have ever been found anywhere outside Africa The Asian hominids would have had to appear as it were spontaneously And anyway an Asianbeginning would merely reverse the problem of their spread you would still have to explain how theJava people then got to Africa so quickly There are several more plausible alternative explanations for how Homo_erectus managed to turnup in Asia so soon_after its first appearance in Africa First a lot of plus or minusing goes into thedating of early human remains If the actual age of the African bones is at the higher end of the rangeof estimates or the Javan ones at the lower end or both then there is plenty of time for African erectsto find their way to Asia It is also entirely possible that older erectus bones await discovery inAfrica In addition the Javan dates could be wrong altogether Now for the doubts Some authorities don't believe that the Turkana finds are Homo_erectus at all The snag ironically was that although the Turkana skeletons were admirably extensive all othererectus fossils are inconclusively fragmentary As Tattersall and Jeffrey Schwartz note in ExtinctHumans most of the Turkana skeleton couldn't be compared with anything_else closely related to itbecause the comparable parts weren't known The Turkana skeletons they say look nothing like anyAsian Homo_erectus and would never have been considered the same species except that they werecontemporaries Some authorities insist on calling the Turkana specimens and any others from thesame period Homo ergaster Tattersall and Schwartz don't believe that goes nearly far enough Theybelieve it was ergaster or a reasonably close relative that spread to Asia from Africa evolved intoHomo erectus and then died out What is certain is that sometime well over a million_years_ago some new comparatively modern upright beings left Africa and boldly spread out across much of the globe They possibly did so quiterapidly increasing their range by as much as twenty_five miles a year on average all while dealingwith mountain ranges rivers deserts and other impediments and adapting to differences in climateand food sources A particular mystery is how they passed along the west side of the Red Sea an areaof famously punishing aridity now but even drier in the past It is a curious irony that the conditionsthat prompted them to leave Africa would have made it much more difficult to do so Yet somehowthey managed to find their way around every barrier and to thrive in the lands beyond And that I'm_afraid is where all agreement ends What happened next in the history of humandevelopment is a matter of long and rancorous debate as we shall_see in the next chapter But it is worth remembering before we move on that all of these evolutionary jostlings over fivemillion years from distant puzzled australopithecine to fully modern human produced a creature thatis still percent genetically indistinguishable from the modern chimpanzee There is moredifference between a zebra and a horse or between a dolphin and a porpoise than there is betweenyou and the furry creatures your distant ancestors left_behind when they set out to take over the world THE RESTLESS APESOMETIME ABOUT A million and a half years_ago some forgotten genius of the hominid world didan unexpected thing He or very possibly she took one stone and carefully used it to shape another The result was a simple teardrop shaped hand axe but it was the world's first piece of advancedtechnology It was so superior to existing tools that soon others were following the inventor's lead and makinghand axes of their own Eventually whole societies existed that seemed to do little else They madethem in the thousands says Ian_Tattersall There are some places in Africa where you literally can'tmove without stepping on them It's strange because they are quite intensive objects to make It was asif they made them for the sheer pleasure of it From a shelf in his sunny workroom Tattersall took down an enormous cast perhaps a foot and ahalf long and eight inches wide at its widest point and handed it to me It was shaped like aspearhead but one the size of a stepping stone As a fiberglass cast it weighed only a few ounces butthe original which was found in Tanzania weighed twenty_five pounds It was completely uselessas a tool Tattersall said It would have taken two people to lift it adequately and even then itwould have been exhausting to try to pound anything with it What was it used for then Tattersall gave a genial shrug pleased at the mystery of it No idea It must have had somesymbolic importance but we can only guess what The axes became known as Acheulean_tools after St Acheul a suburb of Amiens in northernFrance where the first examples were found in the nineteenth_century and contrast with the older simpler tools known as Oldowan originally found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania In older textbooks Oldowan tools are usually shown as blunt rounded hand sized stones In_fact paleoanthropologistsnow tend to believe that the tool part of Oldowan rocks were the pieces flaked off these larger stones which could then be used for cutting Now here's the mystery When early modern_humans the ones who would eventually become us started to move out of Africa something over a hundred thousand years_ago Acheulean_tools were thetechnology of choice These early Homo_sapiens loved their Acheulean_tools too They carried themvast distances Sometimes they even took unshaped rocks with them to make into tools later on Theywere in a word devoted to the technology But although Acheulean_tools have been found throughoutAfrica Europe and western and central Asia they have almost never been found in the Far East Thisis deeply puzzling In the s a Harvard paleontologist named Hallum Movius drew something called the Moviusline dividing the side with Acheulean_tools from the one without The line runs in a southeasterlydirection across Europe and the Middle East to the vicinity of modern day Calcutta and Bangladesh Beyond the Movius line across the whole of southeast Asia and into China only the older simplerOldowan tools have been found We know that Homo_sapiens went far beyond this point so whywould they carry an advanced and treasured stone technology to the edge of the Far East and then justabandon it That troubled me for a long time recalls Alan Thorne of the Australian National University inCanberra The whole of modern anthropology was built round the idea that humans came out ofAfrica in two waves a first wave of Homo_erectus which became Java_Man and Peking Man andthe like and a later more advanced wave of Homo_sapiens which displaced the first lot Yet toaccept that you must believe that Homo_sapiens got so far with their more modern technology andthen for whatever reason gave it up It was all very puzzling to say the least As it turned_out there would be a great_deal else to be puzzled about and one of the most puzzlingfindings of all would come from Thorne's own part of the world in the outback of Australia In a geologist_named Jim Bowler was poking around on a long dried lakebed called Mungo in a parchedand lonely corner of western New South Wales when something very unexpected caught his eye Sticking out of a crescent shaped sand ridge of a type known as a lunette were some human bones Atthe time it was believed that humans had been in Australia for no more than years but Mungohad been dry for years So what was anyone doing in such an inhospitable place The answer provided by carbon dating was that the bones' owner had lived there when LakeMungo was a much more agreeable habitat a dozen miles long full of water and fish fringed bypleasant groves of casuarina trees To everyone's astonishment the bones turned_out to be years_old Other bones found nearby were dated to as much as years This was unexpected tothe point of seeming practically impossible At no time since hominids first arose on Earth hasAustralia not been an island Any human_beings who arrived there must have come by sea in largeenough numbers to start a breeding population after crossing sixty miles or more of open waterwithout having any way of knowing that a convenient landfall awaited them Having landed theMungo people had then found their way more than two thousand miles inland from Australia's northcoast the presumed point of entry which suggests according to a report in the Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences that people may have first arrived substantially earlier than years_ago How they got there and why they came are questions that can't be answered According to mostanthropology texts there's no evidence that people could even speak years_ago much lessengage in the sorts of cooperative efforts necessary to build ocean worthy craft and colonize islandcontinents There's just a whole lot we_don't_know about the movements of people before recorded history Alan Thorne told_me when I met him in Canberra Do you know that when nineteenth centuryanthropologists first got to Papua New Guinea they found people in the highlands of the interior insome of the most inaccessible terrain on earth growing sweet potatoes Sweet potatoes are native toSouth America So how did they get to Papua New Guinea We don't_know Don't have the faintestidea But what is certain is that people have been moving around with considerable assuredness forlonger than traditionally thought and almost_certainly sharing genes as well as information The problem as ever is the fossil_record Very few parts of the world are even vaguely amenableto the long term preservation of human remains says Thorne a sharp eyed man with a white goateeand an intent but friendly manner If it weren't for a few productive areas like Hadar and Olduvai ineast Africa we'd know frighteningly little And when you look elsewhere often we do knowfrighteningly little The whole of India has yielded just one ancient human fossil from about years_ago Between Iraq and Vietnam that's a distance of some kilometers there have beenjust two the one in India and a Neandertal in Uzbekistan He grinned That's not a whole hell of alot to work with You're left with the position that you've got a few productive areas for humanfossils like the Great Rift Valley in Africa and Mungo here in Australia and very little in between It's not surprising that paleontologists have trouble connecting the dots The traditional theory to explain human movements and the one still accepted by the majority ofpeople in the field is that humans dispersed across Eurasia in two waves The first wave consistedof Homo_erectus who left Africa remarkably quickly almost as soon as they emerged as a species beginning nearly two million_years_ago Over time as they settled in different regions these earlyerects further evolved into distinctive types into Java_Man and Peking Man in Asia and Homoheidelbergensis and finally Homo neanderthalensis in Europe Then something over a hundred thousand years_ago a smarter lither species of creature theancestors of every one of us alive_today arose on the African plains and began radiating outward ina second wave Wherever they went according to this theory these new Homo_sapiens displacedtheir duller less adept predecessors Quite how they did this has always been a matter of disputation No signs of slaughter have ever been found so most authorities believe the newer hominids simplyoutcompeted the older ones though other factors may also have contributed Perhaps we gave themsmallpox suggests Tattersall There's no real way of telling The one certainty is that we are herenow and they aren't These first modern_humans are surprisingly shadowy We know less about ourselves curiouslyenough than about almost any other line of hominids It is odd indeed as Tattersall notes that themost recent major event in human evolution the emergence of our_own species is perhaps the mostobscure of all Nobody can even quite agree where truly modern_humans first appear in the fossilrecord Many books place their debut at about years_ago in the form of remains found at theKlasies River Mouth in South Africa but not everyone accepts that these were fully modern people Tattersall and Schwartz maintain that whether any or all of them actually represent our species stillawaits definitive clarification The first undisputed appearance of Homo_sapiens is in the eastern Mediterranean around modernday Israel where they begin to show up about years_ago but even there they are described by Trinkaus and Shipman as odd difficult to classify and poorly known Neandertals werealready well established in the region and had a type of tool kit known as Mousterian which themodern humans evidently found worthy enough to borrow No Neandertal remains have ever beenfound in north Africa but their tool kits turn up all over the place Somebody must have taken themthere modern_humans are the only candidate It is also known that Neandertals and modern humanscoexisted in some fashion for tens of thousands of years in the Middle East We don't_know if theytime shared the same space or actually lived side by side Tattersall says but the moderns continuedhappily to use Neandertal tools hardly convincing evidence of overwhelming superiority No lesscuriously Acheulean_tools are found in the Middle East well over a million_years_ago but scarcelyexist in Europe until just years_ago Again why people who had the technology didn't takethe tools with them is a mystery For a long time it was believed that the Cro Magnons as modern_humans in Europe becameknown drove the Neandertals before them as they advanced across the continent eventually forcingthem to its western margins where essentially they had no choice but to fall in the sea or go extinct Infact it is now known that Cro Magnons were in the far west of Europe at about the same time theywere also coming in from the east Europe was a pretty empty place in those days Tattersall says They may not have encountered each other all that often even with all their comings and goings One curiosity of the Cro Magnons' arrival is that it came at a time known to paleoclimatology as theBoutellier interval when Europe was plunging from a period of relative mildness into yet anotherlong spell of punishing cold Whatever it was that drew them to Europe it wasn't the gloriousweather In any case the idea that Neandertals crumpled in the face of competition from newly arrived CroMagnons strains against the evidence at_least a little Neandertals were nothing if not tough For tensof thousands of years they lived through conditions that no modern human outside a few polarscientists and explorers has experienced During the worst of the ice_ages blizzards with hurricaneforce winds were common Temperatures routinely fell to degrees below zero Fahrenheit Polarbears padded across the snowy vales of southern England Neandertals naturally retreated from theworst of it but even so they will have experienced weather that was at_least as bad as a modernSiberian winter They suffered to be sure a Neandertal who lived much past thirty was luckyindeed but as a species they were magnificently resilient and practically indestructible Theysurvived for at_least a hundred thousand years and perhaps twice that over an area stretching fromGibraltar to Uzbekistan which is a pretty successful run for any species of being Quite who they were and what they were like remain matters of disagreement and uncertainty Right up until the middle of the twentieth_century the accepted anthropological view of the Neandertalwas that he was dim stooped shuffling and simian the quintessential caveman It was only apainful accident that prodded scientists to reconsider this view In while doing fieldwork in theSahara a Franco Algerian paleontologist named Camille Arambourg took refuge from the midday sununder the wing of his light airplane As he sat there a tire burst from the heat and the plane tippedsuddenly striking him a painful blow on the upper body Later in Paris he went for an X ray of hisneck and noticed that his own vertebrae were aligned exactly like those of the stooped and hulkingNeandertal Either he was physiologically primitive or Neandertal's posture had been misdescribed In_fact it was the latter Neandertal vertebrae were not simian at all It changed utterly how weviewed Neandertals but only some of the time it appears It is still commonly held that Neandertals lacked the intelligence or fiber to compete on equal termswith the continent's slender and more cerebrally nimble newcomers Homo_sapiens Here is a typicalcomment from a recent book Modern humans neutralized this advantage the Neandertal'sconsiderably heartier physique with better clothing better fires and better shelter meanwhile theNeandertals were stuck with an oversize body that required more food to sustain In other words thevery factors that had allowed them to survive successfully for a hundred thousand years suddenlybecame an insuperable handicap Above_all the issue that is almost never addressed is that Neandertals had brains that weresignificantly larger than those of modern people liters for Neandertals versus for modernpeople according to one calculation This is more than the difference between modern Homo sapiensand late Homo_erectus a species we are happy to regard as barely human The argument put forwardis that although our brains were smaller they were somehow more efficient I believe I speak the truthwhen I observe that nowhere else in human evolution is such an argument made So why then you may well ask if the Neandertals were so stout and adaptable and cerebrally wellendowed are they no_longer with us One possible but much disputed answer is that perhaps theyare Alan Thorne is one of the leading proponents of an alternative theory known as the multiregionalhypothesis which holds that human evolution has been continuous that just as australopithecinesevolved into Homo_habilis and Homo heidelbergensis became over time Homo neanderthalensis somodern Homo_sapiens simply emerged from more ancient Homo forms Homo_erectus is on thisview not a separate species but just a transitional phase Thus modern Chinese are descended fromancient Homo_erectus forebears in China modern Europeans from ancient European Homo_erectus and so on Except that for me there are no Homo_erectus says Thorne I think it's a term which hasoutlived its usefulness For me Homo_erectus is simply an earlier part of us I believe only onespecies of humans has ever left Africa and that species is Homo_sapiens Opponents of the multiregional theory reject it in the first instance on the grounds that it requiresan improbable amount of parallel evolution by hominids throughout the Old World in Africa China Europe the most distant islands of Indonesia wherever they appeared Some also believe thatmultiregionalism encourages a racist view that anthropology took a very long time to rid itself of Inthe early_s a famous anthropologist named Carleton Coon of the University of Pennsylvaniasuggested that some modern races have different sources of origin implying that some of us comefrom more superior stock than others This hearkened back uncomfortably to earlier beliefs that somemodern races such as the African Bushmen properly the Kalahari San and Australian Aborigineswere more primitive than others Whatever Coon may personally have felt the implication for many people was that some races areinherently more advanced and that some humans could essentially constitute different species Theview so instinctively offensive now was widely popularized in many respectable places until fairlyrecent times I have before me a popular_book published by Time Life Publications in calledThe Epic of Man based on a series of articles in Life magazine In it you can find such comments as Rhodesian man lived as recently as years_ago and may have been an ancestor of theAfrican Negroes His brain size was close to that of Homo_sapiens In other words black Africanswere recently descended from creatures that were only close to Homo_sapiens Thorne emphatically and I believe sincerely dismisses the idea that his theory is in any measureracist and accounts for the uniformity of human evolution by suggesting that there was a lot ofmovement back and forth between cultures and regions There's no reason to suppose that peopleonly went in one direction he says People were moving all over the place and where they metthey almost_certainly shared genetic_material through interbreeding New arrivals didn't replace theindigenous populations they joined them They became them He likens the situation to whenexplorers like Cook or Magellan encountered remote peoples for the first time They weren'tmeetings of different species but of the same species with some physical differences What you actually see in the fossil_record Thorne insists is a smooth continuous transition There's a famous skull from Petralona in Greece dating from about years_ago that has beena matter of contention among traditionalists because it seems in some ways Homo_erectus but in otherways Homo_sapiens Well what we say is that this is just what you would expect to find in speciesthat were evolving rather than being displaced One thing that would help to resolve matters would be evidence of interbreeding but that is not atall easy to prove or disprove from fossils In archeologists in Portugal found the skeleton of achild about four years_old that died years_ago The skeleton was modern overall but withcertain archaic possibly Neandertal characteristics unusually sturdy leg bones teeth bearing adistinctive shoveling pattern and though not everyone agrees on it an indentation at the back ofthe skull called a suprainiac fossa a feature exclusive to Neandertals Erik Trinkaus of WashingtonUniversity in St Louis the leading authority on Neandertals announced the child to be a hybrid proof that modern_humans and Neandertals interbred Others however were troubled that theNeandertal and modern features weren't more blended As one critic put it If you look at a mule youdon't have the front end looking like a donkey and the back end looking like a horse Ian_Tattersall declared it to be nothing more than a chunky modern child He accepts that theremay well have been some hanky panky between Neandertals and moderns but doesn't believe itcould have resulted in reproductively successful offspring I don't_know of any two organismsfrom any realm of biology that are that different and still in the same species he says With the fossil_record so unhelpful scientists have turned increasingly to genetic studies in particularthe part known as mitochondrial DNA Mitochondrial DNA was only discovered in but by the s some ingenious souls at the University of California at Berkeley had realized that it has twofeatures that lend it a particular convenience as a kind of molecular clock it is passed on only throughthe female line so it doesn't become scrambled with paternal DNA with each new generation and itmutates about twenty times faster than normal nuclear DNA making it easier to detect and followgenetic patterns over time By tracking the rates of mutation they could work out the genetic historyand relationships of whole groups of people In the Berkeley team led by the late Allan Wilson did an analysis of mitochondrial DNAfrom individuals and declared that the rise of anatomically modern_humans occurred in Africawithin the last years and that all present day humans are descended from that population Itwas a serious blow to the multiregionalists But then people began to look a little more closely at thedata One of the most extraordinary points almost too extraordinary to credit really was that the Africans used in the study were actually African Americans whose genes had obviously beensubjected to considerable mediation in the past few hundred years Doubts also soon emerged aboutthe assumed rates of mutations By the study was largely discredited But the techniques of genetic analysis continued to berefined and in scientists from the University of Munich managed to extract and analyze someDNA from the arm bone of the original Neandertal man and this time the evidence stood up TheMunich study found that the Neandertal DNA was unlike any DNA found on Earth now stronglyindicating that there was no genetic connection between Neandertals and modern_humans Now thisreally was a blow to multiregionalism Then in late Nature and other publications reported on a Swedish study of the mitochondrialDNA of fifty three people which suggested that all modern_humans emerged from Africa within thepast years and came from a breeding stock of no more than individuals Soonafterward Eric Lander director of the Whitehead Institute Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyCenter for Genome Research announced that modern Europeans and perhaps people farther afield are descended from no more than a few hundred Africans who left their homeland as recently as years_ago As we have noted elsewhere in the book modern human_beings show remarkably little geneticvariability there's more diversity in one social group of fifty five chimps than in the entire humanpopulation as one authority has put it and this would explain why Because we are recentlydescended from a small founding population there hasn't been time enough or people enough toprovide a source of great variability It seemed a pretty severe blow to multiregionalism After this a Penn State academic told the Washington Post people won't be too concerned about themultiregional theory which has very little evidence But all of this overlooked the more or less infinite capacity for surprise offered by the ancientMungo people of western New South Wales In early Thorne and his colleagues at theAustralian National University reported that they had recovered DNA from the oldest of the Mungospecimens now dated at years and that this DNA proved to be genetically distinct The Mungo Man according to these findings was anatomically modern just like you and me butcarried an extinct genetic lineage His mitochondrial DNA is no_longer found in living humans as itshould be if like all other modern people he was descended from people who left Africa in therecent past It turned everything upside down again says Thorne with undisguised delight Then other even more curious anomalies began to turn up Rosalind Harding a populationgeneticist at the Institute of Biological Anthropology in Oxford while studying betaglobin genes inmodern people found two variants that are common among Asians and the indigenous people ofAustralia but hardly exist in Africa The variant genes she is certain arose more than yearsago not in Africa but in east Asia long before modern Homo_sapiens reached the region The onlyway to account for them is to say that ancestors of people now living in Asia included archaichominids Java_Man and the like Interestingly this same variant gene the Java_Man gene so tospeak turns up in modern populations in Oxfordshire Confused I went to see Harding at the institute which inhabits an old brick villa on Banbury Roadin Oxford in more or less the neighborhood where Bill Clinton spent his student days Harding is asmall and chirpy Australian from Brisbane originally with the rare knack for being amused andearnest at the same time Don't know she said at once grinning when I_asked her how people in Oxfordshire harboredsequences of betaglobin that shouldn't be there On the whole she went on more somberly thegenetic record supports the out of Africa hypothesis But then you find these anomalous clusters which most geneticists prefer not to talk about There's huge_amounts of information that would beavailable to us if only we could understand it but we don't yet We've barely begun She refused tobe drawn out on what the existence of Asian origin genes in Oxfordshire tells us other than that thesituation is clearly complicated All we can say at this stage is that it is very untidy and we don'treally know why At the time of our meeting in early another Oxford scientist named Bryan Sykes had justproduced a popular_book called The Seven Daughters of Eve in which using studies ofmitochondrial DNA he had claimed to be able to trace nearly all living Europeans back to a foundingpopulation of just seven women the daughters of Eve of the title who lived between and years_ago in the time known to science as the Paleolithic To each of these women Sykes hadgiven a name Ursula Xenia Jasmine and so on and even a detailed personal history Ursulawas her mother's second child The first had been taken by a leopard when he was only two When I_asked Harding aboutwhere to go with her answer popularize a difficult subject possibility that he's right Shethe book she smiled broadly but carefully as if not quite certain Well I suppose you must give him some credit for helping toshe said and paused thoughtfully And there remains the remotelaughed then went on more intently Data from any single genecannot really tell you anything so definitive If you follow the mitochondrial DNA backwards it willtake you to a certain place to an Ursula or Tara or whatever But if you take any other bit of DNA any gene at all and trace it back it will take you someplace else altogether It was a little I gathered like following a road randomly out of London and finding that eventuallyit ends at John O'Groats and concluding from this that anyone in London must therefore have comefrom the north of Scotland They might have come from there of course but equally they could havearrived from any of hundreds of other places In this sense according to Harding every gene is adifferent highway and we have only barely begun to map the routes No single gene is ever going totell you the whole story she said So genetic studies aren't to be trusted Oh you can trust the studies well enough generally speaking What you can't trust are thesweeping conclusions that people often attach to them She thinks out of Africa is probably percent correct but adds I think both_sides have done abit of a disservice to science by insisting that it must be one thing or the other Things are likely toturn out to be not so straightforward as either camp would have you believe The evidence is clearlystarting to suggest that there were multiple migrations and dispersals in different parts of the worldgoing in all kinds of directions and generally mixing up the gene pool That's never going to be easy tosort out Just at this time there were also a number of reports questioning the reliability of claimsconcerning the recovery of very ancient DNA An academic writing in Nature had noted how apaleontologist asked by a colleague whether he thought an old skull was varnished or not had lickedits top and announced that it was In the process noted the Nature article large amounts ofmodern human DNA would have been transferred to the skull rendering it useless for future study Iasked Harding about this Oh it would almost_certainly have been contaminated already she said Just handling a bone will contaminate it Breathing on it will contaminate it Most of the water in ourlabs will contaminate it We are all swimming in foreign DNA In order to get a reliably cleanspecimen you have to excavate it in sterile conditions and do the tests on it at the site It is thetrickiest thing in the world not to contaminate a specimen So should such claims be treated dubiously I_asked Harding nodded solemnly Very she said If you wish to understand at once why we know as little as we do about human origins I have theplace for you It is to be found a little beyond the edge of the blue Ngong Hills in Kenya to the southand west of Nairobi Drive out of the city on the main highway to Uganda and there comes a momentof startling glory when the ground falls away and you are presented with a hang glider's view ofboundless pale green African plain This is the Great Rift Valley which arcs across three thousand miles of east Africa marking thetectonic rupture that is setting Africa adrift from Asia Here perhaps forty miles out of Nairobi alongthe baking valley floor is an ancient site called Olorgesailie which once stood beside a large andpleasant lake In long after the lake had vanished a geologist_named J W Gregory wasscouting the area for mineral prospects when he came across a stretch of open ground littered withanomalous dark stones that had clearly been shaped by human hand He had found one of the greatsites of Acheulean tool manufacture that Ian_Tattersall had told_me about Unexpectedly in the autumn of I found myself a visitor to this extraordinary site I was inKenya for another purpose altogether visiting some projects run by the charity CARE International but my hosts knowing of my interest in humans for the present volume had inserted a visit toOlorgesailie into the schedule After its discovery by Gregory Olorgesailie lay undisturbed for over two decades before thefamed husband and wife team of Louis and Mary Leakey began an excavation that isn't completed yet What the Leakeys found was a site stretching to ten acres or so where tools were made inincalculable numbers for roughly a million_years from about million_years_ago to yearsago Today the tool beds are sheltered from the worst of the elements beneath large tin lean tos andfenced off with chicken wire to discourage opportunistic scavenging by visitors but otherwise thetools are left just where their creators dropped them and where the Leakeys found them Jillani Ngalli a keen young_man from the Kenyan National Museum who had been dispatched to actas guide told_me that the quartz and obsidian rocks from which the axes were made were never foundon the valley floor They had to carry the stones from there he said nodding at a pair of mountainsin the hazy middle distance in opposite directions from the site Olorgesailie and Ol Esakut Eachwas about ten kilometers or six miles_away a long way to carry an armload of stone Why the early Olorgesailie people went to such trouble we can only guess of course Not only didthey lug hefty stones considerable distances to the lakeside but perhaps even more remarkably theythen organized the site The Leakeys' excavations revealed that there were areas where axes werefashioned and others where blunt axes were brought to be resharpened Olorgesailie was in short akind of factory one that stayed in business for a million_years Various replications have shown that the axes were tricky and labor intensive objects to make even with practice an axe would take hours to fashion and yet curiously they were not particularlygood for cutting or chopping or scraping or any of the other tasks to which they were presumably put So we are left with the position that for a million_years far far longer than our_own species haseven been in existence much less engaged in continuous cooperative efforts early people came inconsiderable numbers to this particular site to make extravagantly large numbers of tools that appearto have been rather curiously pointless And who were these people We have no idea actually We assume they were Homo erectusbecause there are no other known candidates which means that at their peak their peak theOlorgesailie workers would have had the brains of a modern infant But there is no physical evidenceon which to base a conclusion Despite over sixty years of searching no human bone has ever beenfound in or around the vicinity of Olorgesailie However much time they spent there shaping rocks itappears they went elsewhere to die It's all a mystery Jillani Ngalli told_me beaming happily The Olorgesailie people disappeared from the scene about years_ago when the lake driedup and the Rift Valley started to become the hot and challenging place it is today But by this timetheir days as a species were already numbered The world was about to get its first real master race Homo_sapiens Things would never be the same again GOOD BYEIN THE EARLY s at just about the time that Edmond Halley and his friends Christopher Wrenand Robert Hooke were settling down in a London coffeehouse and embarking on the casual wagerthat would result eventually in Isaac Newton's Principia Henry Cavendish's weighing of the Earth and many of the other inspired and commendable undertakings that have occupied us for much of thepast four_hundred pages a rather less desirable milestone was being passed on the island ofMauritius far out in the Indian Ocean some eight hundred miles off the east coast of Madagascar There some forgotten sailor or sailor's pet was harrying to death the last of the dodos the famouslyflightless bird whose dim but trusting nature and lack of leggy zip made it a rather irresistible targetfor bored young tars on shore leave Millions of years of peaceful isolation had not prepared it for theerratic and deeply unnerving behavior of human_beings We don't_know precisely the circumstances or even year attending the last moments of the lastdodo so we_don't_know which arrived first a world that contained a Principia or one that had nododos but we do know that they happened at more or less the same time You would be hard pressed I would submit to find a better pairing of occurrences to illustrate the divine and felonious nature ofthe human being a species of organism that is capable of unpicking the deepest secrets of theheavens while at the same time pounding into extinction for no purpose at all a creature that neverdid us any harm and wasn't even remotely capable of understanding what we were doing to it as wedid it Indeed dodos were so spectacularly short on insight it is reported that if you wished to findall the dodos in a vicinity you had only to catch one and set it to squawking and all the others wouldwaddle along to see what was up The indignities to the poor dodo didn't end quite there In some seventy years after the lastdodo's death the director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford decided that the institution's stuffeddodo was becoming unpleasantly musty and ordered it tossed on a bonfire This was a surprisingdecision as it was by this time the only dodo in existence stuffed or otherwise A passing employee aghast tried to rescue the bird but could save only its head and part of one limb As a result of this and other departures from common sense we are not now entirely sure what aliving dodo was like We possess much less information than most people suppose a handful ofcrude descriptions by unscientific voyagers three or four oil paintings and a few scattered osseousfragments in the somewhat aggrieved words of the nineteenth_century naturalist H E Strickland AsStrickland wistfully observed we have more physical evidence of some ancient sea monsters andlumbering saurapods than we do of a bird that lived into modern times and required nothing of us tosurvive except our absence So what is known of the dodo is this it lived on Mauritius was plump but not tasty and was thebiggest ever member of the pigeon family though by quite what margin is unknown as its weight wasnever accurately recorded Extrapolations from Strickland's osseous fragments and the Ashmolean'smodest remains show that it was a little over two and a half feet tall and about the same distance frombeak tip to backside Being flightless it nested on the ground leaving its eggs and chicks tragicallyeasy prey for pigs dogs and monkeys brought to the island by outsiders It was probably extinct by and was most certainly gone by Beyond that we know almost nothing except of course thatwe will not see its like again We know nothing of its reproductive habits and diet where it ranged what sounds it made in tranquility or alarm We don't possess a single dodo egg From beginning to end our acquaintance with animate dodos lasted just seventy years That is abreathtakingly scanty period though it must be said that by this point in our history we did havethousands of years of practice behind us in the matter of irreversible eliminations Nobody knowsquite how destructive human_beings are but it is a fact that over the last fifty thousand years or sowherever we have gone animals have tended to vanish in often astonishingly large numbers In America thirty genera of large animals some very large indeed disappeared practically at astroke after the arrival of modern_humans on the continent between ten and twenty thousand years_ago Altogether North and South_America between them lost about three quarters of their big animals onceman the hunter arrived with his flint headed spears and keen organizational capabilities Europe andAsia where the animals had had longer to evolve a useful wariness of humans lost between a thirdand a half of their big creatures Australia for exactly the opposite reasons lost no less than percent Because the early hunter populations were comparatively small and the animal populations trulymonumental as many as ten million mammoth carcasses are thought to lie frozen in the tundra ofnorthern Siberia alone some authorities think there must be other explanations possibly involvingclimate change or some kind of pandemic As Ross MacPhee of the American_Museum of NaturalHistory put it There's no material benefit to hunting dangerous animals more often than you need to there are only so many mammoth steaks you can eat Others believe it may have been almostcriminally easy to catch and clobber prey In Australia and the Americas says Tim_Flannery theanimals probably didn't know enough to run away Some of the creatures that were lost were singularly spectacular and would take a little managing ifthey were still around Imagine ground sloths that could look into an upstairs window tortoises nearlythe size of a small Fiat monitor lizards twenty feet long basking beside desert highways in WesternAustralia Alas they are gone and we live on a much diminished planet Today across the wholeworld only four types of really hefty a metric ton or more land animals survive elephants rhinos hippos and giraffes Not for tens of millions of years has life on Earth been so diminutive and tame The question that arises is whether the disappearances of the Stone Age and disappearances ofmore recent times are in effect part of a single extinction event whether in short humans areinherently bad_news for other living_things The sad likelihood is that we may well be According tothe University of Chicago paleontologist David Raup the background rate of extinction on Earththroughout biological history has been one species lost every four years on average According to onerecent calculation human caused extinction now may be running as much as times that level In the mid_s the Australian naturalist Tim_Flannery now head of the South Australian Museumin Adelaide became struck by how little we seemed to know about many extinctions includingrelatively recent ones Wherever you looked there seemed to be gaps in the records piecesmissing as with the dodo or not recorded at all he told_me when I met him in Melbourne a year orso ago Flannery recruited his friend Peter Schouten an artist and fellow Australian and together theyembarked on a slightly obsessive quest to scour the world's major collections to find out what waslost what was left and what had never been known at all They spent four years picking through oldskins musty specimens old drawings and written descriptions whatever was available Schoutenmade life sized paintings of every animal they could reasonably re create and Flannery wrote thewords The result was an extraordinary book called A Gap in Nature constituting the most complete and it must be said moving catalog of animal extinctions from the last three hundred years For some animals records were good but nobody had done anything much with them sometimesfor years sometimes forever Steller's sea cow a walrus like creature related to the dugong was oneof the last really big animals to go extinct It was truly enormous an adult could reach lengths ofnearly thirty feet and weigh ten tons but we are acquainted with it only because in a Russianexpedition happened to be shipwrecked on the only place where the creatures still survived in anynumbers the remote and foggy Commander Islands in the Bering Sea Happily the expedition had a naturalist Georg Steller who was fascinated by the animal Hetook the most copious notes says Flannery He even measured the diameter of its whiskers Theonly thing he wouldn't describe was the male genitals though for some reason he was happyenough to do the female's He even saved a piece of skin so we had a good idea of its texture Weweren't always so lucky The one thing Steller couldn't do was save the sea cow itself Already hunted to the brink ofextinction it would be gone altogether within twenty seven years of Steller's discovery of it Manyother animals however couldn't be included because too little is known about them The DarlingDowns hopping mouse Chatham Islands swan Ascension Island flightless crake at_least five types oflarge turtle and many others are forever lost to us except as names A great_deal of extinction Flannery and Schouten discovered hasn't been cruel or wanton but justkind of majestically foolish In when a lighthouse was built on a lonely rock called StephensIsland in the tempestuous strait between the North and South Islands of New_Zealand the lighthousekeeper's cat kept bringing him strange little birds that it had caught The keeper dutifully sent somespecimens to the museum in Wellington There a curator grew very excited because the bird was arelic species of flightless wrens the only example of a flightless perching bird ever found anywhere He set_off at once for the island but by the time he got there the cat had killed them all Twelvestuffed museum species of the Stephens Island flightless wren are all that now exist At least we have those All too often it turns_out we are not much better at looking after speciesafter they have gone than we were before they went Take the case of the lovely Carolina parakeet Emerald green with a golden head it was arguably the most striking and beautiful bird ever to live inNorth America parrots don't usually venture so far north as you may have noticed and at its peakit existed in vast numbers exceeded only by the passenger pigeon But the Carolina parakeet was alsoconsidered a pest by farmers and easily hunted because it flocked tightly and had a peculiar habit offlying up at the sound of gunfire as you would expect but then returning almost at once to check onfallen comrades In his classic American Omithology written in the early nineteenth_century Charles Willson Pealedescribes an occasion in which he repeatedly empties a shotgun into a tree in which they roost At each successive discharge though showers of them fell yet the affection of the survivorsseemed rather to increase for after a few circuits around the place they again alighted near me looking down on their slaughtered companions with such manifest symptoms of sympathy andconcern as entirely disarmed me By the second decade of the twentieth_century the birds had been so relentlessly hunted that only afew remained alive in captivity The last one named Inca died in the Cincinnati Zoo in notquite four years after the last passenger pigeon died in the same zoo and was reverently stuffed Andwhere would you go to see poor Inca now Nobody knows The zoo lost it What is both most intriguing and puzzling about the story above is that Peale was a lover of birds andyet did not hesitate to kill them in large numbers for no better reason than that it interested him to doso It is a truly astounding fact that for the longest time the people who were most intensely interestedin the world's living_things were the ones most likely to extinguish them No one represented this position on a larger scale in every sense than Lionel Walter Rothschild the second Baron Rothschild Scion of the great banking family Rothschild was a strange andreclusive fellow He lived his entire life in the nursery wing of his home at Tring inBuckinghamshire using the furniture of his childhood even sleeping in his childhood bed thougheventually he weighed three hundred pounds His passion was natural_history and he became a devoted accumulator of objects He sent hordes oftrained men as many as four_hundred at a time to every quarter of the globe to clamber overmountains and hack their way through jungles in the pursuit of new specimens particularly thingsthat flew These were crated or boxed up and sent back to Rothschild's estate at Tring where he and abattalion of assistants exhaustively logged and analyzed everything that came before them producinga constant stream of books papers and monographs some twelve hundred in all Altogether Rothschild's natural_history factory processed well over two million specimens and added fivethousand species of creature to the scientific archive Remarkably Rothschild's collecting efforts were neither the most extensive nor the mostgenerously funded of the nineteenth_century That title almost_certainly belongs to a slightly earlier butalso very wealthy British collector named Hugh Cuming who became so preoccupied withaccumulating objects that he built a large oceangoing ship and employed a crew to sail the world fulltime picking up whatever they could find birds plants animals of all types and especially shells It was his unrivaled collection of barnacles that passed to Darwin and served as the basis for hisseminal study However Rothschild was easily the most scientific collector of his age though also the mostregrettably lethal for in the s he became interested in Hawaii perhaps the most temptinglyvulnerable environment Earth has yet produced Millions of years of isolation had allowed Hawaii toevolve unique species of animals and plants Of particular interest to Rothschild were theislands' colorful and distinctive birds often consisting of very small populations inhabiting extremelyspecific ranges The tragedy for many Hawaiian birds was that they were not only distinctive desirable and rare a dangerous combination in the best of circumstances but also often heartbreakingly easy to take The greater koa finch an innocuous member of the honeycreeper family lurked shyly in the canopiesof koa trees but if someone imitated its song it would abandon its cover at once and fly down in ashow of welcome The last of the species vanished in killed by Rothschild's ace collectorHarry Palmer five years after the disappearance of its cousin the lesser koa finch a bird so sublimelyrare that only one has ever been seen the one shot for Rothschild's collection Altogether during thedecade or so of Rothschild's most intensive collecting at_least nine species of Hawaiian birdsvanished but it may have been more Rothschild was by no means alone in his zeal to capture birds at more or less any cost Others infact were more ruthless In when a well known collector named Alanson Bryan realized that hehad shot the last three specimens of black mamos a species of forest bird that had only beendiscovered the previous decade he noted that the news filled him with joy It was in short a difficult age to fathom a time when almost any animal was persecuted if it wasdeemed the least bit intrusive In New_York State paid out over one hundred bounties foreastern mountain lions even though it was clear that the much harassed creatures were on the brink ofextinction Right up until the s many states continued to pay bounties for almost any kind ofpredatory creature West Virginia gave out an annual college scholarship to whoever brought in themost dead pests and pests was liberally interpreted to mean almost anything that wasn't grown onfarms or kept as pets Perhaps nothing speaks more vividly for the strangeness of the times than the fate of the lovely littleBachman's warbler A native of the southern United_States the warbler was famous for its unusuallythrilling song but its population numbers never robust gradually dwindled until by the s thewarbler vanished altogether and went unseen for many years Then in by happy coincidencetwo separate birding enthusiasts in widely separated locations came across lone survivors just twodays apart They both shot the birds and that was the last that was ever seen of Bachman's warblers The impulse to exterminate was by no means exclusively American In Australia bounties werepaid on the Tasmanian tiger properly the thylacine a doglike creature with distinctive tiger stripes across its back until shortly before the last one died forlorn and nameless in a privateHobart zoo in Go to the Tasmanian Museum today and ask to see the last of this species theonly large carnivorous marsupial to live into modern times and all they can show you arephotographs The last surviving thylacine was thrown out with the weekly trash I mention all this to make the point that if you were designing an organism to look after life in ourlonely cosmos to monitor where it is going and keep a record of where it has been you wouldn'tchoose human_beings for the job But here's an extremely salient point we have been chosen by fate or Providence or whatever youwish to call it As far as we can tell we are the best there is We may be all there is It's an unnervingthought that we may be the living universe's supreme achievement and its worst nightmaresimultaneously Because we are so remarkably careless about looking after things both when alive and when not we have no idea really none at all about how many things have died off permanently or may soon or may never and what role we have played in any part of the process In in the book TheSinking Ark the author Norman Myers suggested that human activities were causing about twoextinctions a week on the planet By the early_s he had raised the figure to some six hundred perweek That's extinctions of all types plants insects and so on as well as animals Others have putthe figure even higher to well over a thousand a week A United Nations report of on theother hand put the total number of known extinctions in the last four_hundred years at slightly under for animals and slightly over for plants while allowing that this was almost_certainly anunderestimate particularly with regard to tropical species A few interpreters think most extinctionfigures are grossly inflated The fact is we_don't_know Don't have any idea We don't_know when we started doing many of thethings we've done We don't_know what we are doing right now or how our present actions will affectthe future What we do know is that there is only one planet to do it on and only one species of beingcapable of making a considered difference Edward_O_Wilson expressed it with unimprovablebrevity in The Diversity of Life One planet one experiment If this book has a lesson it is that we are awfully lucky to be here and by we I mean everyliving thing To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement Ashumans we are doubly lucky of course We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also thesingular ability to appreciate it and even in a multitude of ways to make it better It is a talent wehave only barely begun to grasp We have arrived at this position of eminence in a stunningly short time Behaviorally modernhuman beings that is people who can speak and make art and organize complex activities haveexisted for only about percent of Earth's history But surviving for even that little while hasrequired a nearly endless string of good fortune We really are at the beginning of it all The trick of course is to make sure we never find the end And that almost_certainly will require a good deal more than lucky breaks CHAPTER HOW TO BUILD A UNIVERSE Protons are so small that Bodanis_E_mc p Now pack into that tiny tiny space Guth The

obviouslyand indefinitely The little superscript number signifies the number of zeroes following the larger principal number Negative notationsprovide essentially a mirror image with the superscript number indicating the number of spaces to the right of the decimal point so means Though I salute the principle it remains an amazement to me that anyone seeing x km would see at once thatthat

eighteen years later Return to text Triangulation their chosen method was a popular technique based on the geometric fact that if you know the length of one side of atriangle and the angles of two corners you can work out all its other dimensions without leaving your chair Suppose by way of example that you and I decided we wished to know how far it is to the Moon Using triangulation the first thing we must do is put some distancebetween us so let's say for argument that you stay in Paris and I go to Moscow and we both look at the Moon at the same time Now ifyou imagine a line connecting the three principals of this exercise that is you and I and the Moon it forms a triangle Measure thelength of the baseline between you and me and the angles of our two corners and the rest can be simply calculated Because the interiorangles of a triangle always add up to degrees if you know the sum of two of the angles you can instantly calculate the third andknowing the precise shape of a triangle and the length of one side tells you the lengths of the other sides This was in fact the methoduse by a Greek astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea in B C to work out the Moon's distance from Earth At ground level theprinciples of triangulation are the same except that the triangles don't reach into space but rather are laid side to side on a map Inmeasuring a degree of meridian the surveyors

summation by the chemist P W Atkins just to provide a sense of them There are four Laws The third of them the SecondLaw was recognized first the first the Zeroth Law was formulated last the First Law was second the Third Law might not even be alaw in the same sense as the others In briefest terms the second law states that a little energy is always wasted You can't have aperpetual motion device because no matter how efficient it will always lose energy and eventually run down The first law says that youcan't create energy and the third that you can't reduce temperatures to absolute zero there will always be some residual warmth AsDennis Overbye notes the three principal laws are sometimes expressed jocularly as you can't win you can't break even and you can't get out of the game Return to text The notable exception being the Tyrannosaurus rex which was found by Barnum Brown in Return to text The confusion over the aluminum aluminium spelling arose because of some uncharacteristic indecisiveness on Davy's part When hefirst isolated the element in he called it alumium For some reason he thought better of that and changed it to aluminum four yearslater Americans dutifully adopted the new term but many British users disliked aluminum pointing out that it disrupted the ium patternestablished by sodium calcium and strontium so they added a vowel and syllable Return to text The principle led to the much later adoption of Avogadro's number a basic unit of measure in chemistry which was named forAvogadro long after his death It is the number of molecules found in grams of hydrogen gas or an equal volume of any othergas Its value is placed at x which is an enormously large number Chemistry students have long amused themselves bycomputing just how large a number it is so I can report that it is equivalent to the number of popcorn kernels needed to cover the UnitedStates to a depth of nine miles or cupfuls of water in the Pacific Ocean or soft drink cans that would evenly stacked cover the Earth toa depth of miles An equivalent number of American pennies would be enough to make every person on Earth a dollar trillionaire Itis a big number Return

after the fact Since Nobel_Prizes are never awarded posthumously longevity can be as important a factor as ingenuity for prizewinners Return to text How c came to be the symbol for the speed of light is something of a mystery but David Bodanis suggests it probably came from theLatin celeritas meaning swiftness The relevant volume of the Oxford English Dictionary compiled a decade before Einstein's

believe for a single moment Return to text If you have ever wondered how the atoms determine which percent will die and which percent will survive for the next session the answer is that the half life is really just a statistical convenience a kind of actuarial table for elemental things Imagine you had asample of material with a half life of seconds It isn't that every atom in the sample will exist for exactly seconds or seconds or seconds or some other tidily ordained period Each atom will in fact survive for an entirely random length of time that has nothing todo with multiples of it might last until two seconds from now or it might oscillate away for years or decades or centuries to come Noone can say But what we can say is that for the sample as a whole the rate of disappearance will be such that half the atoms willdisappear every seconds It's an average rate in other words and you can apply it to any large sampling Someone once worked out for_instance that dimes have a half

You are of course entitled to wonder what is meant exactly by a constant of or a constant of The answer lies inastronomical units of measure Except conversationally astronomers don't use light years

universe are measured in megaparsecs a million parsecs The constant is expressed in terms ofkilometers per second per megaparsec Thus when astronomers refer to a Hubble constant of what they really

cumulus cloud there is a pronounced boundary between the moist interior of the cloud and the dryair beyond it Any water molecule that strays beyond the edge of the cloud is immediately zapped by the dry air beyond allowing thecloud to keep its fine edge Much higher cirrus clouds are composed of ice and the zone between the edge of the cloud and the airbeyond is not so clearly delineated which is

DRAWING ROOMIIf you had to summarize it in a sentence you could say that the historyof private life is a history of getting comfortable slowly Until theeighteenth century the idea of having comfort at home was sounfamiliar that no word existed for the condition Comfortable meantmerely capable of being consoled Comfort was something you gave tothe wounded or distressed The first person to use the word in itsmodern sense was the writer Horace Walpole who remarked in a letterto a friend in that a certain Mrs White was looking after him welland making him as comfortable as is possible By the early nineteenthcentury everyone was talking_about having a comfortable home orenjoying a comfortable living but before Walpole's day no one did Nowhere in the house is the spirit if not always the actuality ofcomfort better captured than in the curiously named room in which wefind ourselves now the drawing room The term is a shortening of themuch older withdrawing room meaning a space where the family couldwithdraw from the rest of the household for greater privacy and it hasnever settled altogether comfortably into widespread English usage Fora time in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries drawing room waschallenged in more refined circles by the French salon which wassometimes anglicized to saloon but both those words gradually becameassociated with spaces outside the home so that saloon came first tosignify a roomfor socializing in a hotel or on a ship then a place fordedicated drinking and finally and a little unexpectedly a type ofautomobile Salon meanwhile became indelibly attached to placesassociated with artistic endeavors before being appropriated from about by providers of hair care and beauty treatments Parlor the wordlong favored by Americans for the main room of the home has a kind ofnineteenth century frontier feel to it but in fact is the oldest word of all It was first used in referring to a room where monks could go totalk it is from the French parler to speak and was extended tosecular contexts by the last quarter of the following century Drawing room is the name used by Edward Tull on his floorplan ofthe Old Rectory and almost_certainly is the term employed by the wellbred Mr Marsham though he was probably in a minority even then Bymid century it was being supplanted in all but the most genteel circlesb y sitting room a term first appearing in English in A laterchallenger was lounge which originally signified a type of chair or sofa then a jacket for relaxing in and finally from a room In America living room came into being in about and quite rapidly droveparlor out of use there but failed to catch on elsewhere Assuming he was a conventional sort of fellow Mr Marsham wouldhave strived to make his drawing room the most comfortable room in thehouse with the softest and finest furnishings In practice however itwas probably anything but comfortable for much of the year since it hasjust one fireplace which could do no more than warm a small centralpart of the room Even with a good fire going I can attest it is possiblein the depths of winter to stand across the room and see your breath Though the drawing room became the focus of comfort in the home the story doesn't actually start there it doesn't start in the house at all It starts outdoors a century or so before Mr Marsham's birth with asimple discovery that would make landed families like his very rich andallow him one day to build himself a handsome rectory The discoverywas merely this land didn't have to be rested regularly to retain itsfertility It was not the most staggering of insights but it changed theworld Traditionally most English farmland was divided into longstripscalled furlongs and each furlong was left fallow for one season inevery three sometimes one season in two so that it could recover itsability to produce healthy crops This meant that in any given year atleast one third of the nation's farmland stood idle In consequence therewasn't sufficient feed to keep large numbers of animals alive throughthe winter so landowners had no choice but to slaughter most of theirstock each autumn and face a long lean period till spring Then English farmers discovered something that Dutch farmers hadknown for a long time if turnips clover or one or two other amenablecrops were sown on the idle fields they miraculously refreshed the soiland produced a bounty of winter fodder into the bargain It was theinfusion of nitrogen that did it though no one would understand that fornearly two hundred years What was understood and very muchappreciated was that crop rotation transformed agricultural fortunesdramatically Moreover because more animals lived through the winter they produced heaps of additional manure and these glorious gratisploppings enriched the soil even further It is hard to exaggerate what a miracle all this seemed Before theeighteenth century agriculture in Britain lurched from crisis to crisis An academic named W G Hoskins calculated in that between and one harvest in four was bad and almost one in five wascatastrophically bad Now thanks to the simple expedient of croprotation agriculture was able to settle into a continuous more or lessreliable prosperity It was this long golden age that gave so much of thecountryside the air of prosperous comeliness it enjoys still today andallowed the likes of Mr Marsham to embrace that gratifying newcommodity comfort Farmers also benefited from a new wheeled contraption invented inabout by Jethro Tull a farmer and agricultural thinker inBerkshire Called a seed drill it allowed seeds to be planted directlyinto the soil rather than broadcast by hand Seed was expensive andTull's new drill reduced the amount needed from three or four bushelsper acre to under one andbecause the seeds were planted at even depthsin neat rows more of them sprouted successfully so yields improveddramatically too from between twenty and forty bushels an acre to asmuch as eighty The new vitality was also reflected in breeding programs Nearly allthe great cattle breeds Jersey Guernsey Hereford Aberdeen Angus Ayrshire were eighteenth_century creations Sheep likewise weresuccessfully manipulated to become the bundles of unnatural fleecinesswe see today A medieval sheep gave about a pound and a half of wool re engineered eighteenth_century sheep gave up to nine pounds Underneath all that lovely fleece sheep were gratifyingly plumper too Between and the average weight of sheep sold at SmithfieldMarket in London more than doubled from thirty eight pounds toeighty Beef cattle expanded similarly Dairy yields went up too All this was not without cost however To make the new systems ofproduction work it was necessary to amalgamate small fields into largeones and move the peasant farmers off the land This enclosuremovement in which small fields that had formerly supported many wereconverted into much larger enclosed fields that enriched a few madefarming immensely lucrative for those with large holdings and soon inmany areas that was almost the only kind of holding there was Enclosure had been going on slowly for centuries but it gathered pacebetween and when some six million acres of Britishfarmland were enclosed Enclosure was hard on the displaced peasantfarmers but it did leave them and their descendants convenientlyavailable to move to towns and become the toiling masses of the newIndustrial Revolution which was also just beginning and was fundedto a very large extent by the surplus wealth enjoyed by the ever richerlandowners Many landowners also discovered that they sat on great seams of coaljust at a time when coal was suddenly needed for industry Thisdidn'talways represent a notable advance in beauty at one time in theeighteenth century eighty five open cast coal mines could be seen fromChatsworth House or so it has been said but it did translate intogratifying heaps of lucre Still others made money from leasing land torailways or building canals and controlling rights of way The Duke ofBridgewater earned annual returns of percent and really returnsdon't get much better than that from a canal monopoly in the WestCountry All of this was in an age in which there was no income tax nocapital gains tax no tax on dividends or interest almost nothing todisturb the steady flow of money being banked Many people were borninto a world in which they had to do virtually nothing with their wealthbut stack it The third Earl of Burlington to take one example of many owned vast estates in Ireland some forty two thousand acres in all and never visited the country Eventually he was made lord treasurer ofIreland and still never visited it This wealthy elite and their offspring covered the British countrysidewith stout and rambling expressions of this new joie de richesse By onecount at_least large country houses were built in England between and the end of the century dispersed like

the most popularcomedies of his day The Relapse and The Provok'd Wife Featuringcharacters with names like Fondlewife Lord Foppington Sir TunbellyClumsey and Sir John Brute the plays may seem just a touch heavyhanded to us but were the height of drollery in that overdone and highlyfragranced age It was pretty risqu stuff One scandalized member ofthe Society for the Reformation of Manners said that Vanbrugh haddebauch'd the stage beyond the looseness of all former times Othersloved his plays for exactly the same reasons The poet Samuel Rogersthought him almost as great a genius as ever lived Altogether Vanbrugh would write or adapt ten works for the stage but meanwhile and with no less startling abruptness he also turned histalents to architecture Where this impulse came from was as much amystery to his contemporaries as it is to us All that is known is that in at the age of thirty five he began work on one of the grandesthouses ever built in England Castle_Howard in Yorkshire How hepersuaded his friend Charles Howard third Earl of Carlisle describedby one architectural historian as rather nondescript but obviouslyuncontrollably wealthy to underwrite this seemingly insane ambitionis no less uncertain This was not just a big house it was a place thatwas positively and determinedly palatial built on a scale previously theprerogative of royalty in the words of Vanbrugh's biographer KerryDownes Clearly Carlisle saw something in Vanbrugh's rough sketches and Vanbrugh it must be said did have the backup of a real architect ofundoubted gifts Nicholas Hawks moor who had twenty years ofexperience but was oddly content to work as Vanbrugh's assistant Itseems also that Vanbrugh may have worked for free No indication ofmoney changing hands has ever been found and on both_sides thesewere men who kept track of such things In any case Carlisle dismissedthe distinguished architect he had been planning to use WilliamTalman and gave the novice Vanbrugh free rein Vanbrugh and Carlisle were both members of a secretive societyknown as the Kit Cat Club an organization of Whiggish dispositionthat had been founded more or less exclusively to ensure the Hanoveriansuccession the dynastic change that guaranteed that all future Britishmonarchs would be Protestant even if in the short term they were notnotably British That the Kit Cats achieved this aim was no smallaccomplishment since their candidate George I spoke no English hadalmost no admirable qualities and was by one count no better than fiftyeighth in line to the throne Beyond this one piece of politicalmaneuvering the club operated with such discretion that almost nothingis known about it One of its founding members was a pastry chefnamed Christopher or Kit Cat Kit cat was also the name of hisfamous mutton pies so whether the club was named for him or his pieshas been a matter of debate in certain very small circles for threehundred years The club lasted from only about to specificdetails are unknown and total membership was only about fifty ofwhom two_thirds were peers of the realm Five members LordsCarlisle Halifax and Scarborough and the Dukes of Manchester andMarlborough commissioned work from Vanbrugh Membership alsoincluded the prime minister Robert Walpole father of Horace thejournalists Joseph Addison and Richard Steele and the playwrightWilliam Congreve At Castle_Howard Vanbrugh didn't exactly ignore the classicalproprieties he just buried them under a kind of kudzu of baroqueornamentation A Vanbrugh structure is always like no other but CastleHoward is as itwere unusually unusual It had a large number of formalrooms thirteen on one floor but few bedrooms nothing like theamount that would normally be expected Many rooms were oddlyshaped or poorly lit Much of the external detailing is unusual if notactually erratic The columns on one side of the house are simple Doric but those on the other are a more ornate Corinthian Vanbrugh argued with some logic that no one could see the two sides at the same time The most striking characteristic of all for at_least a quarter century wasthat the house was built without its west wing though this was not infact Vanbrugh's fault Carlisle got distracted and neglected to put up thewest wing leaving the house conspicuously unfinished When the wingwas finally built twenty_five years later by another party it was in anentirely different style so that the visitor today is met with a baroqueeast wing as Vanbrugh intended and an inescapably unmatchingPalladian west wing that pleased a later owner and hardly anyone else Castle Howard's most famous feature its domed crown formally alantern from a Greek_word meaning to admit light over the entrancehall was a late addition and is strikingly out of scale with the buildingbeneath it It is too tall and too thin It looks as if it were designed foranother structure altogether One architectural critic noted diplomatically that at close quarters it does not fit very logically on tothe building below It was at_least novel The only other domedstructure in England at the time was Christopher Wren's new St Paul'sCathedral No house anywhere had ever had anything like it Castle_Howard is in short a very fine property but fine in a way thatis entirely its own The dome may be slightly odd but Castle Howardwould be nothing without it We can say that with unusual confidencebecause for twenty years Castle_Howard was without it Late on thenight of November a fire was discovered in the east wing Inthose days the house had just one telephone and the phone melted likechocolate before anyone could get to it So someone had to run to thegatehouse a mile away and call the fire department from there By thetime the fire crew arrived from Malton six miles distant two hours hadpassed and much of the house was lost The dome had crumpled in theheat and fallen into the house Castle_Howard was domeless for the nexttwenty years and it looked allright it was still stately still imposing still stolidly grand but it had lost its perk When the dome was finallyrestored in the early_s it became instantly and peculiarly endearingonce again Despite his limited experience Vanbrugh now landed the commissionfor one of the most important houses ever built in Great Britain Blenheim Palace that colossal explosion of magnificence at Woodstockin Oxfordshire Blenheim was intended to be a gift from the nation tothe Duke of Marlborough for his victory over the French in the Battle ofBlindheim somehow anglicized into Blenheim in Bavaria in The estate came with twenty two thousand acres of prime land whichbrought an income of a year a hale sum for the time but not alas nearly enough to pay for a house on the scale of Blenheim andBlenheim was so big as to be effectively off any scale It contained three hundred rooms and sprawled over seven acres Afrontage of feet for a stately home was enormous at Blenheim thefrontage was to be feet It was the greatest monument to vanityBritain had ever seen Every inch of it was covered in decorative stonysumptuousness It was grander than any royal palace and so notsurprisingly very very expensive The duke a fellow member of theKit Cat Club seems to have gotten along with Vanbrugh well enough but after agreeing the general principles of the thing he went off tofight more wars leaving domestic arrangements in the hands of his wife Sarah Duchess of Marlborough She thus oversaw most of the work and from the start she and Vanbrugh did not get along At all Work began in the summer of and was trouble from the start Many costly adjustments had to be made along the way The principalentrance had to be changed when a cottage owner refused to move sothe main gate had to be located in an odd place at the back of the town requiring visitors to pass along the high street turn a corner and enterthe grounds through what even today feels oddly like a tradesman'sentrance albeit rather a grand one Blenheim was budgeted to cost Ultimately it cost about This was unfortunate as the Marlboroughs were notoriouslyparsimonious The duke was so cheap that he refused to dot his i s whenhe wrote to save on ink It was never clear who was to pay for the work Queen Anne the treasury or the Marlboroughs themselves Theduchess and Queen Anne had a close rather strange and just possiblyintimate relationship When alone they gave each other odd pet names Mrs Morley and Mrs Freeman to avoid any awkwardnessarising from the fact that one of them was regal and the other was not Unfortunately the building of Blenheim coincided with a cooling oftheir affections which added to the uncertainty of financialresponsibility Things grew more complicated still after the queen diedin and was replaced by a king who felt no particular affection for or debt to the Marlboroughs Many of the builders went unpaid foryears as the disputes dragged on and most eventually got only a fractionof what they were owed Building work ceased altogether for four years from to and many of the unpaid workers wereunderstandably loath to return when work resumed Vanbrugh himselfdidn't get paid until almost exactly twenty years after workstarted Even when things were moving along Vanbrugh and the duchesssquabbled endlessly She thought the palace too big too dark and toomartial She accused Vanbrugh of extravagance and insubordination and became implacably convinced that he was a bad thing In shedismissed him altogether though at the same time instructing theworkmen to stay faithful to his plans When Vanbrugh came with hiswife in to see the finished building a building on which he hadlavished some two_thirds of his architectural career and one third of hislife he was informed at the gate that the duchess had left standinginstructions that he was not to be admitted to the grounds So he neversaw his finished masterwork except as a shimmer in the distance Eightmonths later he was dead Like Castle_Howard Blenheim is in a baroque style but even moreso Its roofline is a festive eruption of orbs and urns and other uprightembellishments Many people hated its monumental scale andostentation The Earl of Ailesbury dismissed it as one mass of stonewithout taste or relish Alexander Pope after exhaustively enumeratingits failings concluded In a word it is a most expensive absurdity The Duke of Shrewsbury dismissed it as a great quarry of stones aboveground A wag named Abel Evans wrote a mock epitaph for Vanbrugh Lie heavy on him earth for heLaid many a heavy load on thee Blenheim is a gloriously overwrought piece of work without question but transfixing nonetheless and the scale is so off the chart that it canhardly fail to awe the first time visitor It is hard to believe that anyonewould want to live in such an oppressive vastness and in fact the Marlboroughs barely did They didn't move in until and the duke diedjust two years later Whatever one thought of Vanbrugh and his creations the age of thecelebrity architect had begun Before Vanbrugh's day architects weren't much celebrated Generally fame went to those who paid for the houses not those whodesignedthem Hardwick Hall which we encountered in Chapter wasone of the great buildings of its age yet it is merely supposed thatRobert Smythson was the architect It is a pretty good supposition forall kinds of reasons but there is no actual proof of it Smythson was infact the first man to be called an architect or nearly to be called anarchitect on a monument of about in which he is described as architector and survayor But as with so many others of his era verylittle is known about his early life including where he was born andwhen He makes his first appearance in the records at Longleat House atWiltshire in when he was already in his thirties and a mastermason Where he was before that is completely unknown Even after architecture became a recognized profession mostpractitioners came from other backgrounds Inigo Jones was a designerof theatrical productions Christopher Wren an astronomer RobertHooke a scientist Vanbrugh a soldier and playwright William Kent apainter and interior designer As a formal profession architecture wasactually very late developing Compulsory examinations were notintroduced until in Britain and architecture wasn't offeredanywhere as a full time academic discipline until By the mid eighteenth_century however domestic architecture wasgetting a lot of respect and attention and for a time no one had more ofboth than Robert Adam If Vanbrugh was the first celebrity architect Adam was the greatest Born in in Scotland the son of anarchitect he was one of a quartet of brothers who all became successfularchitects though Robert was the undoubted genius of the family andthe one remembered by history The period from to issometimes called the Age of Adam A painting of Adam in the National Portrait Gallery in London madein about when he was in his early forties shows a kindly lookingman in a powdered gray wig but in fact Adam was not a particularlyadorable fellow Arrogant and egotistical he treated his employeespoorly paying them little and keeping them in a kind of perpetualservitude He fined them severely if they were caught doing any workother than for him even a sketch for their own amusement Adam'sclients however venerated his abilities and for thirty years simplycouldn't give him enough work The Adam brothers became a kind ofarchitectural industry They owned quarries a timber business brickworks a company for making stucco and much else At one pointthey employed two thousand people They designed not just houses butevery object within them furniture fireplaces carpets beds lamps and all else down to incidental objects like doorknobs bell pulls andinkstands Adam's designs were intense sometimes overwhelming andgradually he fell out of favor He had an inescapable weakness foroverdecoration To walk into an Adam room is rather like walking into alarge overfrosted cake Indeed one of his contemporary critics calledhim a Pastry Cook By the late_s Adam was being denounced as sugary and effeminate and had fallen so far out of fashion that heretreated to his native Scotland where he died in By he wasso thoroughly forgotten that the influential Lives of the Most EminentBritish Architects didn't mention him at all The banishment didn't lastterribly long however By the s his reputation was undergoing arevival which continues now though these days he is remembered morefor his rich interiors than for his architecture The one thing all buildings had in common through Adam's day was arigorous devotion to symmetry Vanbrugh to be sure didn't entirelyachieve symmetry at Castle_Howard but that was largely accidental Elsewhere however symmetry was adhered to as an immutable law ofdesign Every wing had to have a matching wing whether it was neededor not and every window and pediment to one side of the main entrancehad to be exactly mirrored by windows and pediments on the other sideregardless of what went on behind them The result often was thebuilding of wings that no one really wanted Not_until the nineteenthcentury did this absurdity begin to end and it was a remarkable propertyin Wiltshire one of the most extraordinary ever built that started theprocess It was called Fonthill Abbey and it was the creation of two strangeand fascinating men William Beckford and the architect James Wyatt Beckford was fabulously rich His family owned plantations all acrossJamaica and had dominated the West Indian sugar trade for a hundredyears Beckford's doting mother made sure her son enjoyed everyadvantage in his upbringing The eight year old Wolfgang Mozart wasbroughtin to give him piano lessons Sir William Chambers the king'sarchitect taught him to draw Beckford's wealth was so inexhaustiblygreat that when he came into his inheritance on his twenty first birthday he spent an obscenely colossal sum on the party Byron in apoem called him England's wealthiest son probably rightly In Beckford became the centerpiece of the most spectacularlyjuicy scandal of his age when it emerged that he was involved in a pairof tempestuous wildly dangerous dalliances One was with LouisaBeckford the wife of his first cousin At the same time he also fell for aslim and delicate youth named William Courtenay the future ninth Earlof Devon who was generally agreed to be the most beautiful boy inEngland For a few torrid and presumably exhausting years Beckfordmaintained both relationships often under the same roof But in theautumn of there was a sudden rupture Beckford received ordiscovered a note in Courtenay's hand that threw him into a fit ofjealous rage No record exists of what the note said but it provokedBeckford into intemperate action He went to Courtenay's room and inthe slightly confused words of one of the other houseguests horsewhipped him which created a noise and the door being opened Courtenay was discovered in his shirt and Beckford in some posture orother Strange story Indeed The particular misfortune here was that Courtenay was the darling ofhis family he was the only boy among fourteen siblings andshockingly youthful He was sixteen at the time of the incident but mayhave been as young as ten when he fell under Beckford's unwholesomesway This was not a matter that Courtenay's family would ever let drop and we may take it for granted that Beckford's cuckolded cousin wasless than jubilant too Disgraced beyond any hope of redemption Beckford fled to the continent There he traveled widely and wrote inFrench a gothic novel called Vathek An Arabian Tale which isvirtually unreadable now but was much admired in its day Then in his disgrace nowhere near over Beckford did a whollyunexpected thing He returned to England and announced a plan to teardown the family mansion in Wiltshire Fonthill Splendens which wasonly about forty years_old and build a new house in its place and notjust anyhouse but the largest house in England since Blenheim It was astrange thing to do for he had no prospect of ever filling it withcompany The architect he selected for this slightly demented exercisewas James Wyatt Wyatt is a curiously neglected figure His only substantial biography by Antony Dale was published over half a century ago He wouldperhaps be more famous but for the fact that so many of his buildings nolonger exist Today he is remembered more for what he destroyed thanwhat he built Born in Staffordshire the son of a farmer Wyatt was drawn toarchitecture as a young_man and spent six years in Italy studyingarchitectural drawing In aged just twenty four he designed thePantheon an exhibition hall and assembly room loosely modeled onthe ancient building of the same name in Rome which occupied a primesite on Oxford Street in London for years Horace Walpole thoughtit the most beautiful edifice in England Unfortunately Marks andSpencer didn't and in tore it down to make way for a new store Wyatt was an architect of talent and distinction under George III hewas appointed Surveyor of the Office of Works in effect officialarchitect to the nation but a perennial shambles as a human being Hewas disorganized forgetful perpetually dissolute and famous for histremendous benders One year he missed fifty straight weekly meetingsat the Office of Works His supervision of the office was so poor thatone man was discovered to have been on holiday for three years Whensober however he was much liked and widely praised for his charm good nature and architectural vision A bust of him in the NationalPortrait Gallery in London shows him clean shaven and indeed clean aslightly unusual condition for him with a very full head of hair and aface that seems curiously mournful or perhaps just slightly hungover Despite his shortcomings he became the most sought after architectof his day However he took on more commissions than he couldmanage and seldom gave satisfactory attention to anyone to the endlessexasperation of his clients If he can get with a large fire and have abottle by him he cares for nothing else wrote one of his manyfrustrated customers There is an overwhelming consensus of opinion observed hisbiographer Dale that Wyatt had three outstanding faults an entire lackof business capability the complete incapacity for constant orintensiveapplication and utter improvidence And these were thewords of a sympathetic observer Wyatt was in short feckless andimpossible A client named William Windham stuck it out for elevenyears on a job that should have taken a fraction of the time A personhas some right to feel impatient Windham wearily wrote his absentarchitect at one point finding the principal rooms of his house nearuninhabitable because he has not been able to obtain from you whatwould not be the work of a couple of hours To be a Wyatt client wasto be long suffering Yet Wyatt's career was both successful and remarkably productive Over a span of forty years he built or refashioned a hundred countryhouses extravagantly reworked five cathedrals and did much to changethe face of British architecture not always it must be said for thegood His treatment of cathedrals was particularly rash and sweeping Acritic named John Carter was so exercised by Wyatt's predilection forripping out ancient interiors that he dubbed him the Destroyer anddevoted essays in the Gentleman's Magazine essentially hiswhole career to attacking Wyatt's style and character At Durham Cathedral Wyatt had plans to surmount the building witha mighty spire This never came to pass which is perhaps no bad thing for at Fonthill Wyatt would soon show that there were few places moredangerous to be than under a Wyatt tower He also wished to sweepaway the ancient Galilee Chapel the last resting place of the VenerableBede and one of the great achievements of English Norman architecture Happily that plan was rejected too Beckford was enthralled by Wyatt's dashing genius but driven tosputtering fury by his unreliability Still he somehow managed to keepthe wayward architect focused enough to draw a plan and work startedshortly before the turn of the century Everything at Fonthill was designed on a fantastic scale Windowsstood fifty feet high Staircases were as wide as they were long Thefront door rose to a height of thirty feet but was made to seem even tallerby Beckford's practice of employing dwarf doormen Eighty footcurtains hung from the four arches in the Octagon a central chamberfrom which radiated four long arms The view down the central corridorstretched for over three hundred feet The dining room table Beckfordits only occupant night after night was fifty feet long Every ceilingwas lost in a distant gloom of hammerbeams Fonthill was very possiblythe most exhausting residence ever built and all for a man who livedalone and was known everywhere as the man on whom no neighbourwould call To preserve his privacy Beckford built a formidable wall known as the Barrier around the estate It was twelve feet high twelvemiles long and surmounted by iron spikes to deter trespassers The Great Western Hall leading to the Grand Saloon or Octagon atFonthill AbbeyAmong the additional incidental planned structures was a mightytomb feet long in which his coffin would be placed on a dais feet above the ground so that he believed no worms could ever get tohim Fonthill was deliberately and riotously asymmetrical architecturalanarchy in the words of the historian Simon Thurley and rendered inan ornate Gothic style that made it look like a cross between a medievalcathedral and Dracula's castle Wyatt didn't invent neo Gothicism Thatdistinction goes to Horace Walpole for his house Strawberry Hill inouter London Gothick as it was sometimes spelled to distinguish itfrom the genuine medieval stuff originally signaled not an architecturalstyle but a type of gloomy overwrought novel and Walpole inventedthat too with The Castle of Otranto in Strawberry Hill however was a fairly cautious picturesque sort of thing a more or lessconventional house with some Gothic tracery and other embellishmentsattached Wyatt's Gothic creations were vastly darker and heavier Theyhad looming towers and romantic spires and jumbled rooflines that werestudiously asymmetrical so that they looked as if the whole structurehad grown organically over centuries It was a kind of Hollywoodimagining of the past long before there was a Hollywood Walpoleinvented a term gloomth to convey the ambience of Gothick Wyatt'shouses were the very quintessence of gloomth They dripped it In his obsession to get the project completed Beckford kept up to fivehundred men working round the clock but things constantly wentwrong Fonthill's tower rising to a height of feet was the tallestever put on a private house and it was a nightmare Rashly Wyatt useda new kind of rendering called Parker's Roman cement invented by aReverend James Parker of Gravesend yet another of that inquisitivebreed of clergymen whom we encountered at the outset of the book What impulse brought the Reverend Mr Parker to the world of buildingmaterials is unknown but his idea was to produce a quick dryingcement of the type once used by the Romans from a recipe since lost Unfortunately his cement had little inherent strength and if not mixedexactly correctly tended to fall apart in chunks as it did now atFonthill Appalled Beckford found his mighty abbey coming to pieceseven as it went up Twice it collapsed during construction Even whenfully erect it creaked and groaned ominously To Beckford's boundless exasperation Wyatt was often either awaydrunk or working on other projects Just as things were literally fallingapart at Fonthill and the five hundred workers were either running fortheir lives or twiddling their thumbs awaiting instructions Wyatt wasengaged in a massive abortive project to build King George III a newpalace at Kew Why George III wanted a new palace at Kew is areasonable question as he had a very good one there already but Wyattwent ahead and designed a formidable edifice nicknamed the Bastille because of its forbidding looks one of the first buildings anywhere touse cast iron as a structural material We don't_know what the new palace looked like because noreproduction of it exists but it must have been something It was madecompletely of cast iron except for doors and floorboards a design thatwould have given it all the charm and comfort of a cooking pot Unfortunately as the building rose beside the Thames the king began tolose his sight and his interest in things he couldn't see Also he neverliked Wyatt much So with the building half finished and more than wasted work was stopped ten years after it began and neverresumed The structure stood empty and uncompleted for years until anew king George IV finally had it pulled down Throughout their fractious relationship Beckford bombardedWyattwith outraged letters What putrid inn what stinking tavern orpox ridden brothel hides your hoary and glutinous limbs ran onetypical inquiry His pet name for Wyatt was Bagasse pimp Everyletter was a screed of rage and inventive insult Wyatt was to be sure maddening Once he left Fonthill to go to London ostensibly on urgentbusiness but got only three miles to another property owned byBeckford where he fell in with another boozy guest A week laterBeckford discovered them there together insensate and surrounded byempty bottles The final cost of Fonthill Abbey is unknown but in aninformed observer suggested that Beckford had already spent enough to build two Crystal Palaces and the building was less thanhalf done Beckford moved into the abbey in the summer of eventhough it was uncompleted There was no comfort in it at all Sixtyfires had to be kept continually burning winter and summer to keep thehouse dry let alone warm Simon Thurley records in Lost Buildings ofBritain Most of the bedrooms were as plain as monastic cells thirteenhad no windows Beck ford's own bedchamber strikingly austere contained a single narrow bed Wyatt continued to attend intermittently and to drive Beckford to furywith his absences In early September just after his sixty seventhbirthday Wyatt was riding back to London from Gloucestershire with aclient when his carriage overturned and he was dashed against the wall striking his head a fatal blow He died more or less instantly leaving hiswidow penniless Just at this time sugar prices went into a depression and Beckfordended up uncomfortably exposed to the downside of capitalism By he was so strapped for funds that he was forced to sell Fonthill Itwas bought for by an eccentric character John Farquhar whohad been born in rural Scotland but went to India as a young_man andmade a fortune manufacturing gunpowder Returning to England in Farquhar settled in London in a fine house on Portman Square which he conspicuously neglected He conspicuously neglected himself too to such an extent that on his walks through the neighborhood hewas sometimes stopped and questioned as a suspicious vagrant Afterbuying Fonthill he hardly ever visited it He was however in residenceon the most spectacular day in Fonthill's brief existence just beforeChristmas when the tower emitted a sustained groan thencollapsed for a third and final time A servant was blown thirty feetdown a corridor by the rush of air but miraculously neither he noranyone else was injured About a third of the house lay under theheaped wreckage of the tower and would never be habitable again Farquhar was remarkably equable about his misfortune and merelyremarked that this greatly simplified the care of the place He died thefollowing year immensely rich but intestate and none of his bickeringrelatives would take on the house What remained of it was torn downand cleared away not long after Beckford meanwhile took his and retired to Bath wherehe built a foot tower in a restrained classical style Called theLansdown Tower it was erected with good materials and prudent care and still stands IIFonthill marked the summit not only of ambition and folly in thedomestic realm but also of discomfort A curious inverse relationshiphad arisen it seems between the amount of effort and expense that wentinto a house and the extent to which it was actually habitable The greatage of housebuilding brought new levels of elegance and grandeur toprivate life in Britain but almost nothing in the way of softness warmth and convenience Those homely attributes would be the creation of a new type ofperson who had scarcely existed a generation or so before the middleclass professional There had always been people of middling rank ofcourse but as a distinct entity and force to be reckoned with the middleclass was an eighteenth_century phenomenon The term middle classwasn't coined until in a book on the Irish wool trade of allthings but from that point onward the streets and coffeehouses ofBritain abounded with confident voluble well to do people whoanswered to that description bankers lawyers artists publishers designers merchants property developers and others of generallycreative spirit and high ambition This new and swelling middle classserved not only the very wealthy but also even more lucratively oneanother This was the change that made the modern world The invention of the middle class injected new levels of demand intosociety Suddenly there were swarms of people with splendid townhouses that all needed furnishing and just as suddenly the world wasfull of desirable objects with which to fill them Carpets mirrors curtains upholstered and embroidered furniture and a hundred thingsmore that were rarely found in homes before now becamecommonplace The growth of empire and of overseas business interests had adramatic effect too often in unexpected ways Take wood WhenBritain was an isolated island nation it had essentially just one woodfor furniture making oak Oak is a noble material solid long lasting literally hard as iron but it is really only suitable for dense blockyfurniture trunks beds heavy tables and the like But the developmentof the British navy and the spread of Britain's commercial interestsmeant that woods of many types walnut from Virginia tulipwood fromthe Carolinas teak from Asia became available and these changedeverything within the home including how people sat and conversedand entertained The most prized wood of all was mahogany from the Caribbean Mahogany was lustrous warp resistant and sublimely accommodating It could be carved and fretted into the delicate shapes that perfectlysuited the exuberance of rococo yet was strong enough to be a piece offurniture No wood used in England before had had thesecharacteristics suddenly furniture had a sculptural quality The centraluprights of the chairs the splats could be worked in a way that waswondrous to a people who had never seen anything less clunky than aWindsor chair The legs had flowing curves and luscious feet the armsswept along to terminal volutes that were a pleasure to grasp and adelight to behold Every chair indeed every built thing in the house seemed suddenly to have elegance and style and fluidity Mahogany would have been nothing like as esteemed a wood as itwas had it not been for one other magical new material from the otherside of the Earth that gave it the most splendid finish shellac Shellacis a hard resinous secretion from the Indian lac beetle Lac beetlesemerge in swarms in parts of India at certain times of the year and theirsecretions make varnish that is odorless nontoxic brilliantly shiny andhighly resistant to scratches and fading It doesn't attract dust while wet and it driesin minutes Even now in an age of chemistry shellac hasscores of applications against which synthetic products cannot compete When you go bowling it is shellac that gives the alleys their peerlesssheen for_instance New woods and varnishes dramatically broadened the forms thatfurniture could take but something else was needed a new system ofmanufacture to produce the volumes of quality furniture necessary tosatisfy the endless demand Where traditional designers like RobertAdam made a new design for each commission furniture makers nowrealized that it was far more cost effective to make lots of furniture froma single design They began to operate a factory system on a large scale cranking out pieces that were cut from templates then assembled andfinished by teams of specialists The age of mass manufacture had beenborn There is a certain irony in the thought that the people who did the most to establish mass manufacturing techniques were the ones we nowmost revere for their craftsmanship and of no one is that more true thana shadowy furniture maker from the north of England named ThomasChippendale His influence was enormous He was the first commonerfor whom a furniture style was named before him the names faithfullyrecalled monarchies Tudor Elizabethan Louis XIV Queen Anne Yetwe know remarkably little about him We have no idea for_instance what he looked like Except that he was born and grew up in the markettown of Otley on the edge of the Yorkshire dales nothing at all isknown of his early life His first appearance in the written record is in when he arrives in London already aged thirty and sets up as anew type of maker and purveyor of household furnishings known as anupholder That was an ambitious thing to do for upholders' businesses tendedto be complicated and extensive One of the most successful GeorgeSeddon employed four_hundred workmen carvers gilders joiners makers of mirrors and brass and so on Chippendale did not operate onquite that scale but he employed forty or fifty men and his premisescovered two frontages at St_Martin's Lane just around thecorner from the modern Trafalgar Square though that wouldn't exist foranother eighty years He also provided an extremely complete service making and selling chairs occasional tables dressing tables writingtables card tables bookcases bureaus mirrors clock cases candelabra candle stands musicstands sconces commodes and an exotic newcontrivance that he called a sopha Sofas were daring even titillating because they resembled beds and so hinted at salacious repose The firmalso stocked wallpaper and carpets and undertook repairs furnitureremovals and even funerals Thomas Chippendale made indisputably fine furniture but so did lotsof others St_Martin's Lane alone had thirty furniture makers in theeighteenth century and hundreds more were scattered across Londonand throughout the country The reason we all know Chippendale'sname today is that in he did something quite audacious He issueda book of designs called The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director containing plates Architects had been doing this sort of thing fornearly two hundred years but nobody had thought to do it for furniture The drawings were unexpectedly beguiling Instead of being flat twodimensional templates as was standard they were perspective drawings full of shadow and sheen The prospective purchaser could immediatelyvisualize how these handsome and desirable objects would look in hisown home It would be misleading to call Chippendale's book a sensation because only copies were sold but the purchasers included fortynine members of the aristocracy which made it disproportionatelyinfluential It was also snapped up by other furniture makers andcraftsmen raising another point of oddness that Chippendale wasopenly inviting his competitors to make use of his designs for their owncommercial purposes This helped ensure Chippendale's posterity butdidn't do much for his immediate fortunes since potential clients couldnow get Chippendale furniture made more cheaply by any reasonablyskilled joiner It also meant two centuries of difficulty for furniturehistorians in determining which pieces of furniture are genuineChippendales and which are copies made using his book Even if a pieceis a genuine Chippendale it doesn't mean that Thomas Chippendaleever touched it or was even aware of its existence It doesn't evennecessarily mean that he designed it No one knows how much talent hebrought in or whether the designs in his books are in fact from his ownhand A genuine Chippendale simply means that it came from hisworkshop Such is the Chippendale aura however that it needn't even have beenas close to him as that In in colonial Boston a furniture makernamedJohn Welch using a Chippendale pattern as a guide made amahogany desk that he sold to a man named Dublois The desk stayed inthe Dublois family for years In Dublois's descendants put itup for auction with Sotheby's in New_York Though ThomasChippendale had no direct connection to it it sold for just under million Inspired by Chippendale's success other English furniture makersissued pattern books of their own George Hepplewhite's CabinetMaker and Upholsterer's Guide was published in and ThomasSheraton followed with the Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer'sDrawing Book issued in installments between and Sheraton's book had more than twice as many subscribers asChippendale's and was translated into German a distinction notaccorded Chippendale's own volume Hepplewhite and Sheratonbecame particularly popular in America Although any piece of furniture directly associated_with any of thethree is today worth a fortune they were more admired than celebratedin their own lifetimes and at times not even all that admired Chippendale's fortunes slipped first He was an outstanding furnituremaker but hopeless at running a business a deficiency that becameacutely evident upon the death of his business partner James Rannie in Rannie was the brains of the operation without him Chippendalelurched from crisis to crisis for the rest of his life All this was painfullyironic for as he struggled to pay his men and keep himself out of adebtor's cell Chippendale was producing items of the highest qualityfor some of England's richest households and working closely with theleading architects and designers Robert Adam James Wyatt SirWilliam Chambers and others Yet his personal trajectory wasrelentlessly downward It was not an easy age in which to do business Customers wereroutinely slow in paying Chippendale had to threaten David Garrick the actor and impresario with legal action for chronic unpaid bills andstopped work at Nostell Priory a stately home in Yorkshire when thedebt there reached a whopping liability I have not a singleguinea to pay my men with tomorrow he wrote in despair at one point It is clear that Chippendale spent much of his life in a froth of anxiety scarcely for a moment enjoying any sense of security at all At his deathin his personal worth had sunk to just s d not enough tobuy a modestpiece of ormolu from his own showrooms The firmstruggled on under the directorship of his son but finally succumbed tobankruptcy in When Chippendale died the world barely noticed No obituaryappeared in any paper Fourteen years after his death Sheraton wrote ofChippendale's designs that they are now wholly antiquated and laidaside By the late_s Chippendale's reputation had fallen so lowthat the first edition of the Dictionary of National_Biography gave himjust one paragraph far less than it gave Sheraton or Hepplewhite andmuch of that was critical and a good deal of it was wrong The authorwas so little absorbed by the facts of Chippendale's life that he had himcoming from Worcestershire not Yorkshire Sheraton and Hepplewhite could hardlyboast of magnificent success themselves Hepplewhite's shop was in adown at heel district Cripplegate and his identity sufficiently obscurethat his contemporaries referred to him variously as Kepplewhite andHebblethwaite Almost nothing is known of his personal life He hadactually been dead for two years by the time his own book of patternswas published Sheraton's fate was even more curious He seems neverto have opened a shop and no piece of furniture that can be attributed tohim has ever been found He may never have made any but acted merelyas a draftsman and designer Though his book sold well it appears notto have enriched him for he had to supplement his income by teachingdrawing and perspective At some point he gave up furniture design trained as a minister for a nonconformist sect known as the NarrowBaptists and became essentially a street corner preacher He died insqualor among dirt and bugs in London in leaving a wife andtwo children As furniture makers Chippendale and his contemporaries weremasters without any doubt but they enjoyed one special advantage thatcan never be replicated the use of the finest furniture wood that has everexisted a species of mahogany called Swietenia mahogani Found onlyon parts of Cuba and Hispaniola the island today shared by Haiti andthe Dominican Republic in the Caribbean Swietenia mahogani hasnever been matched for richness elegance and utility Such was thedemand for it that it was entirely used up irremediably extinct withinjust fifty years of its discovery Some two hundred other species ofmahogany exist in the world and most are very good woods but theyhave nothing likethe richness and smooth workability of the departed S mahogani The world may one day produce better chairmakers thanChippendale and his peers but it will never produce finer chairs Curiously no one at all appreciated this for the longest time ManyChippendale chairs and other pieces now considered priceless spent acentury or more being casually knocked about in the servants' quartersbefore they were rediscovered and returned to the main house in theEdwardian era Some six hundred pieces of Chippendale furniture havenow been confirmed altogether Others handed down or disposed of inestate sales could easily be sitting unregarded in some country cottageor suburban bungalow more valuable than the houses that contain them IIIIf we were to go back in time to a house in Chippendale's day onedifference that would immediately strike us would be that chairs andother items of furniture were generally pushed up against the walls giving every room the aspect of a waiting room Chairs or tables in themiddle of the room would have looked as out of place to Georgians as awardrobe left in the middle of a room would look to us today Onereason for pushing them aside was to make it easier to walk throughrooms without tripping over furniture in the dark Because they werekept against the wall the backs of early upholstered chairs and setteeswere often left unfinished just as we leave bare the backs of chests andwardrobes today When one had visitors the custom was to bring an appropriatenumber of chairs forward and arrange them in a circle or semicircle rather like storytime in an elementary school This had the inevitableeffect of making nearly all conversations strained and artificial HoraceWalpole after sitting for four and a half hours in an agonizing circle offatuous conversation declared We wore out the Wind and theWeather the Opera and the Play and every topic that would do in aformal circle Yet when daring hostesses tried to introduce spontaneityby arranging chairs into more intimate clusters of threes and fours manyfelt the result was tantamount to pandemonium and more than a fewcould never get used to the idea of conversations taking place behindtheir backs The one problem with the chairs of the age was that they weren't terribly comfortable The obvious solution was to pad them but thatproved more difficult than one might have thought because fewcraftsmen had all the skills necessary to make a good padded chair Manufacturers struggled to get square edges where fabric met wood piping and cording were originally brought in as a way of disguisingthese inadequacies and were frequently out of their depth at producingpadding that would maintain a permanent domed shape on the seat Only saddlers could reliably provide the requisite durability which iswhy so much early upholstered furniture was covered in leather Fabricupholsterers also had the problem that many preindustrial fabrics couldbe produced only in widths of about twenty inches creating a need forseams in awkward places Only after the invention of the flying shuttleby John Kay in did it become possible to produce fabrics in widthsof three feet or so Improvements in textile and printing technologies transformeddecorative possibilities beyond furniture as well This was the age thatsaw the widespread introduction of carpets wallpapers and brightfabrics Paint too became available in a range of bright colors for thefirst time The upshot is that by late in the eighteenth_century households were full of features that would have been the wildestindulgences a century before The modern house a house such as wewould recognize today had begun to emerge At last some fourteenhundred years after the Romans withdrew taking their hot baths padded sofas and central heating with them the British wererediscovering the novel condition of being congenially situated Theyhadn't entirely mastered comfort yet but they had certainly discoveredan alluring concept Life and the expectations that went with it wouldnever be the same again There was however one consequence in all this The advent ofcomfort in the home in particular the widespread use of softfurnishings made furniture much more vulnerable to stains burns andother careless abuses In an effort to save the most valuable furniturefrom the worst of the risks a new type of room was created and it isthere conveniently that we go next A furlong in horse racing is yards or one eighth of a mile but farming furlongs originallywere of no particular length The word means simply long furrow Ayrshires were the creation of Bruce Campbell inventive second cousin of James Boswell who was put in charge of the family estate in Scotland only after Boswell himself declined theresponsibility preferring a life of conversation and refined debauchery in London to dairyfarming in lowland Scotland Had Boswell been more dutiful we would have lost not only hisgreat Life of Johnson but also one of the world's best breeds of dairy cattle Though the name is now pronounced Van bruh or Van burra like the terminal diphthong of Edinburgh or Barbara it appears to have been pronounced Van brook in his ownlifetime It was frequently so spelled Whig is a shortening of Whiggamore the name for a group of seventeenth century Scottishinsurgents Where Whiggamore itself came from is uncertain as is the question of how it thensuggested itself as a suitable name for a group of powerful English aristocrats It was firstapplied derisively by the Tories but embraced with pride by the target group Exactly the samething happened with the term Tory In a large house room numbers are generally notional It depends on the extent to which youcount storerooms closets and the like as separate rooms and also no doubt how carefully onecounts The published numbers for the total rooms at Blenheim range from to quite adisparity It was also come to that the age of the celebrity craftsman One such was the great carverGrinling Gibbons who lived from to His interesting Christian name was hismother's maiden name He grew up in Holland of English parents and came to England in about after the restoration of Charles II as king He settled in Dept ford in southeast London where he made a very basic living carving figureheads for ships One day in John Evelyn the diarist chanced to pass his workshop and was immediately taken with Gibbons's skill personable manner and possibly good looks Gibbons was by all accounts stunningly goodlooking He encouraged the young_man to take on more challenging commissions and introducedhim to people of influence such as Christopher Wren Thanks to Evelyn's support Gibbons became very successful but most of his wealth actually camefrom running a workshop that produced statuary and other stonework It was Gibbons it appears whocame up with the idea of depicting British heroes as Roman statesmen in togas and sandals and thismade his work in stone extremely fashionable Though he is now widely thought of as the greatestwoodcarver in modern times he was not especially famous for it in his own lifetime For BlenheimPalace Gibbons produced worth of decorative stonework but only worth of woodcarving Part of the reason his wood carvings are so valued today is that there aren't very many ofthem Although he is little read now Walpole was immensely popular in his day for his histories andromances He was a particularly adept coiner of words The Oxford English Dictionary creditshim with no fewer than coinages Many like gloomth greenth fluctuable and betweenity didn't take but a great many others
